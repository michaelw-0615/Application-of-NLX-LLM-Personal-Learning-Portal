Abstract
We test the pecking order theory of corporate leverage on a broad cross-section of publicly
traded American ﬁrms for 1971 to 1998. Contrary to the pecking order theory, net equity
issues track the ﬁnancing deﬁcit more closely than do net debt issues. While large ﬁrms exhibit
some aspects of pecking order behavior, the evidence is not robust to the inclusion of
conventional leverage factors, nor to the analysis of evidence from the 1990s. Financing deﬁcit
is less important in explaining net debt issues over time for ﬁrms of all sizes.

1. Introduction
The pecking order theory of capital structure is among the most inﬂuential
theories of corporate leverage. According to Myers (1984), due to adverse selection,
ﬁrms prefer internal to external ﬁnance. When outside funds are necessary, ﬁrms
prefer debt to equity because of lower information costs associated with debt issues.
Equity is rarely issued. These ideas were reﬁned into a key testable prediction by
Shyam-Sunder and Myers (1999). The ﬁnancing deﬁcit should normally be matched
dollar-for-dollar by a change in corporate debt. As a result, if ﬁrms follow the
pecking order, then in a regression of net debt issues on the ﬁnancing deﬁcit, a slope
coefﬁcient of one is observed.
Shyam-Sunder and Myers (1999) ﬁnd strong support for this prediction in a
sample of 157 ﬁrms that had traded continuously over the period 1971 to 1989. This
is an attractive and inﬂuential result. The pecking order is offered as a highly
parsimonious empirical model of corporate leverage that is descriptively reasonable.
Of course, 157 ﬁrms is a relatively small sample from the set of all publicly traded
American ﬁrms. It is therefore important to understand whether the pecking order
theory is broadly applicable.
In this paper, we study the extent to which the pecking order theory of capital
structure provides a satisfactory account of the ﬁnancing behavior of publicly traded
American ﬁrms over the 1971 to 1998 period. Our analysis has three elements. First,
we provide evidence about the broad patterns of ﬁnancing activity. This provides the
empirical context for the more formal regression tests. It also serves as a check on the
signiﬁcance of external ﬁnance and equity issues. Second, we examine a number of
implications of the pecking order in the context of Shyam-Sunder and Myers’ (1999)
regression tests. Finally, we check to see whether the pecking order theory receives
greater support among ﬁrms that face particularly severe adverse selection problems.
The pecking order theory derives much of its inﬂuence from a view that it ﬁts
naturally with a number of facts about how companies use external ﬁnance.1 Myers
(2001) reports that external ﬁnance covers only a small proportion of capital
formation and that equity issues are minor, with the bulk of external ﬁnance being
debt. These key claims do not match the evidence for publicly traded American
ﬁrms, particularly during the 1980s and 1990s. External ﬁnance is much more
signiﬁcant than is usually recognized in that it often exceeds investments. Equity
ﬁnance is a signiﬁcant component of external ﬁnance. On average, net equity issues
commonly exceed net debt issues. Particularly striking is the fact that net equity
issues track the ﬁnancing deﬁcit much more closely than do net debt issues.
Shyam-Sunder and Myers (1999) focus on a regression test of the pecking order.
In this test one needs to construct the ﬁnancing deﬁcit from information in the
corporate accounts. The ﬁnancing deﬁcit is constructed from an aggregation of
1The pecking order theory also derives support from indirect sources of evidence. Eckbo (1986) and
Asquith and Mullins (1986) provide event study evidence that adverse selection is more signiﬁcant for
equity issues than for debt issues. Cadsby et al. (1990) provide experimental evidence of adverse selection
in company ﬁnancing.

dividends, investment, change in working capital and internal cash ﬂows. If the
pecking order theory is correct, then the construction of the ﬁnancing deﬁcit variable
is a justiﬁed aggregation. Under the pecking order, each component of ﬁnancing
deﬁcit should have the predicted dollar-for-dollar impact on corporate debt. The
evidence does not support this hypothesis.
Even if a theory is not strictly correct, when compared to other theories it might
still do a better job of organizing the available evidence. The pecking order is a
competitor to other mainstream empirical models of corporate leverage. Major
empirical alternatives such as the model tested by Rajan and Zingales (1995) use a
different information set to account for corporate leverage. It is therefore of interest
to see how the ﬁnancing deﬁcit performs in a nested model that also includes
conventional factors. The pecking order theory implies that the ﬁnancing deﬁcit
ought to wipe out the effects of other variables. If the ﬁnancing deﬁcit is simply one
factor among many that ﬁrms tradeoff, then what is left is a generalized version of
the tradeoff theory.
We ﬁnd that the ﬁnancing deﬁcit does not wipe out the effects of conventional
variables. The information in the ﬁnancing deﬁcit appears to be factored in along
with many other things that ﬁrms take into account. This is true across ﬁrm sizes and
across time periods.
Since the pecking order does not explain broad patterns of corporate ﬁnance, it is
natural to examine narrower sets of ﬁrms. According to the pecking order theory,
ﬁnancing behavior is driven by adverse selection costs. The theory should perform
best among ﬁrms that face particularly severe adverse selection problems. Small
high-growth ﬁrms are often thought of as ﬁrms with large information asymmetries.
Contrary to this hypothesis, small high-growth ﬁrms do not behave according to
the pecking order theory. In fact, the pecking order works best in samples of large
ﬁrms that continuously existed during the 1970s and the 1980s. Large ﬁrms with long
uninterrupted trading records are not usually considered to be ﬁrms that suffer the
most acute adverse selection problems.
To understand the evidence it is important to recognize the changing population
of public ﬁrms. Compared to the 1970s and 1980s, many more small and
unproﬁtable ﬁrms became publicly traded during the 1990s. Since small ﬁrms
generally do not behave according to the pecking order, this accounts for part of the
reason that the pecking order theory is rejected. But the time period has a stronger
effect than just this. For ﬁrms of all sizes, the ﬁnancing deﬁcit plays a declining role
over time.
Previous literature provides other evidence pertinent to a general assessment of the
pecking order theory. The pecking order theory predicts that high-growth ﬁrms,
typically with large ﬁnancing needs, will end up with high debt ratios because of a
manager’s reluctance to issue equity. Smith and Watts (1992) and Barclay et al.
(2001) suggest precisely the opposite. High-growth ﬁrms consistently use less debt in
their capital structure.
The pecking order theory makes predictions about the maturity and priority
structure of debt. Securities with the lowest information costs should be issued ﬁrst,
before the ﬁrm issues securities with higher information costs. This suggests that
M.Z. Frank, V.K. Goyal / Journal of Financial Economics 67 (2003) 217–248
219
short-term debt should be exhausted before the ﬁrm issues long-term debt.
Capitalized leases and secured debt should be issued before any unsecured debt is
issued. Barclay and Smith (1995a, b) ﬁnd that 50% of their ﬁrm-year observations
have no debt issued with less than one-year maturity, 23% have no secured debt, and
54% have no capital leases. It seems difﬁcult to understand this evidence within a
pure pecking order point of view.
Chirinko and Singha (2000) question the interpretation of the Shyam-Sunder and
Myers (1999) regression test. Chirinko and Singha show that equity issues can create
a degree of negative bias in the Shyam-Sunder and Myers test. Suppose that ﬁrms
actually follow the pecking order theory, but that these ﬁrms issue an empirically
observed amount of equity. In that case, they show that the predicted regression
coefﬁcient is actually 0.74 rather than one. This amount of bias is not trivial, but it
still leaves the coefﬁcient very far from the magnitudes of slope coefﬁcients that are
observed. Chirinko and Singha also point out that if, contrary to the pecking order,
ﬁrms follow a policy of using debt and equity in ﬁxed proportions, then the Shyam-
Sunder and Myers regression will identify this ratio. As a result, ﬁnding a coefﬁcient
near one would not disprove the tradeoff theory. Chirinko and Singha’s cautionary
note reinforces an important methodological point. Most empirical tests have
various weaknesses. It is therefore important to examine the predictions of a theory
from a number of points of view rather than relying solely on a single test.
The structure of the rest of this paper is as follows. Section 2 presents the pecking
order theory and the associated empirical hypotheses. The data are described in
Section 3. Section 4 presents the empirical results. Conclusions are presented in
Section 5.
2. Theory
The pecking order theory is from Myers (1984) and Myers and Majluf (1984).
Since it is well known, we can be brief. Suppose that there are three sources of
funding available to ﬁrms: retained earnings, debt, and equity. Retained earnings
have no adverse selection problem. Equity is subject to serious adverse selection
problems while debt has only a minor adverse selection problem. From the point of
view of an outside investor, equity is strictly riskier than debt. Both have an adverse
selection risk premium, but that premium is large on equity. Therefore, an outside
investor will demand a higher rate of return on equity than on debt. From the
perspective of those inside the ﬁrm, retained earnings are a better source of funds
than is debt, and debt is a better deal than equity ﬁnancing. Accordingly, the ﬁrm
will fund all projects using retained earnings if possible. If there is an inadequate
amount of retained earnings, then debt ﬁnancing will be used. Thus, for a ﬁrm in
normal operations, equity will not be used and the ﬁnancing deﬁcit will match the net
debt issues.
In reality, company operations and the associated accounting structures are more
complex than the standard pecking order representation. This implies that in order
to test the pecking order, some form of aggregation must be used.

We deﬁne notation as follows:
DIVt cash dividends in year t;
It
net investment in year t (i.e., It ¼capital expenditures+increase in invest-
ments+acquisitions+other use of fundssale of PPEsale of investment);
DWt
change in working capital in year t (i.e., DWt ¼change in operating working
capital+change in cash and cash equivalents+change in current debt);
Ct
cash ﬂow after interest and taxes (i.e., Ct ¼income before extraordinary
items+depreciation and amortization+extraordinary items and discontinued
operations+deferred taxes+equity in net lossearnings+other funds from
operations+gain (loss) from sales of PPE and other investments);
Rt
current portion of the long-term debt in year t;
DDt
net debt issued in year t; (i.e., DDt=long-term debt issuancelong-term debt
reduction);
DEt
Net equity issued in year t (i.e., DEt ¼sale of common stock minus stock
repurchases).
Using this notation, we can use the ﬂow of funds data to provide a partially
aggregated form of the accounting cash ﬂow identity as,
DEFt¼ DIVt þ ItþDWt  Ct ¼ D DtþDEt:
ð1Þ
Shyam-Sunder and Myers (1999) argue that under the pecking order hypothesis,
after an Initial Public Offering (IPO), equity issues are only used in extreme
circumstances. The empirical speciﬁcation is thus given as
DDit ¼ a þ bPODEFit þ eit;
ð2Þ
where eit is a well-behaved error term. In Eq. (2), the pecking order hypothesis is that
a ¼ 0 and bPO ¼ 1: Shyam-Sunder and Myers (1999) ﬁnd that the pecking order
model is statistically rejected. However it does provide a good ﬁrst-order
approximation of their data.
In contrast to the accounting deﬁnition, Shyam-Sunder and Myers (1999) include
the current portion of long-term debt as part of the ﬁnancing deﬁcit beyond its role
in the change in working capital. Following their argument, the relevant ﬂow of
funds deﬁcit ðDEFSSM
t
Þ is deﬁned as
DEFSSM
t
¼ DIVt þ ItþDWt þ Rt  Ct:
ð3Þ
If their alternative version of the ﬁnancing deﬁcit is to be used, then replace DEFit
with DEFSSM
t
in Eq. (2). We try both approaches and ﬁnd that empirically the
current portion of long-term debt does not appear to belong in the deﬁnition of
DEFit: With the exception of column (7) of Table 5, we report only the results for
which the current portion of long-term debt is not included as a separate component
of the ﬁnancing deﬁcit. This choice favors the pecking order, but it does not affect
our conclusions.
How is cash to be treated in the ﬁnancing deﬁcit? Changes in cash and cash
equivalents are included with changes in working capital. Cash could be correlated
with the amount of debt issued. This could arise in the presence of lumpy debt and
M.Z. Frank, V.K. Goyal / Journal of Financial Economics 67 (2003) 217–248
221
equity issues, with excess proceeds parked for some period of time in excess cash
balances. If this takes place over a number of years, a more complex dynamic theory
of leverage is needed. We report results in which the change in cash and cash
equivalents are included. This choice favors the pecking order, but the conclusions
are not affected.
In a panel regression, one can treat all year-ﬁrm combinations as equally
important independent observations. If that is done, then a simple regression can be
run. If one is willing to accept the classical error term assumptions, then standard
ﬁxed-effects or random-effects panel estimators may be used. Yet another possibility
is to downplay the differences across time and focus on the cross-sectional
differences. One could follow Fama and MacBeth (1973) and use the average of a
series of annual cross-sectional regressions as the point estimate and use the time
series of these estimates to construct standard errors. This is the approach taken by
Fama and French (2002). We have tried these alternatives and our conclusions are
not sensitive to the choice of approach.
According to theory, the speciﬁcation in Eq. (2) is deﬁned in levels. When actually
estimating Eq. (2), it is conventional to scale the variables by assets or by sales. The
pecking order theory does not require such scaling. Of course, in an algebraic
equality if the right-hand side and the left-hand side are divided by the same value,
the equality remains intact. However, in a regression the estimated coefﬁcient can be
seriously affected if the scaling is by a variable that is correlated with the variables in
the equation. Scaling is most often justiﬁed as a method of controlling for differences
in ﬁrm size. The reported results are based on variables scaled by net assets (total
assets minus current liabilities). We replicate all the tests by scaling variables by total
book assets, by the sum of book debt plus market equity, and by sales. The results
are very similar and do not affect our conclusions.
There is an important econometric issue that needs to be addressed. The pecking
order theory treats the ﬁnancing deﬁcit as exogenous. The ﬁnancing deﬁcit includes
investment and dividends. Yet, much ﬁnancial theory is devoted to attempting to
understand the determinants of these factors. As a result, it is not entirely obvious
that the components of the ﬁnancing deﬁcit should be properly regarded as
exogenous. If they are truly endogenous, then the regression in Eq. (2) is
misspeciﬁed. If a model is misspeciﬁed, then small changes to the speciﬁcation
may lead to large changes in the coefﬁcient estimates. The model is also likely to be
unstable across time periods and its performance would likely not generalize to other
samples of ﬁrms. Such instability would itself be indicative of a failure of the model.
In order to deal with these concerns, two steps are taken. First, all tests are
subjected to a large number of robustness checks. In most cases the ﬁndings are
robust. However, the ﬁndings are not robust on one crucial dimension. Requiring
ﬁrms to have complete trading records over the period 1971–1989 makes a big
difference to the coefﬁcient estimates. Second, the ability of the estimated models to
predict debt issues by a holdout sample of ﬁrms is directly examined. This is a simple
way to address concerns about model misspeciﬁcation. A model may ﬁt well within
sample but its performance may not generalize. Such a model is, of course, much less
interesting than an empirical model that also performs well out of sample.
M.Z. Frank, V.K. Goyal / Journal of Financial Economics 67 (2003) 217–248
222
The ability of each ﬁtted model to predict is tested on data from the ﬁve years
subsequent to (or prior to) the time period over which the model is ﬁt. For each ﬁrm
year in the holdout sample, we plug the actual values of the exogenous variables into
the ﬁtted equation. This provides a predicted value of the endogenous variable
(usually net debt issue). In this manner, we obtain ﬁve years of ﬁrm-speciﬁc
predictions from each ﬁtted model. To assess the quality of these predictions, the
predicted debt issues are regressed against a constant and the actual debt issues. A
good ﬁt will be reﬂected in an intercept of zero, a slope of one, and a high R2: In
order to save space we only report the R2 that is obtained on the hold out sample.
2.1. Using the same information: disaggregation of the ﬁnancing deﬁcit
To test the pecking order theory we need to aggregate the accounting data. Is the
aggregation step justiﬁed? It seems plausible that there could be information in
DEFit that helps to account for DDit; but not in the manner hypothesized by the
pecking order theory. An easy way to check whether the aggregation step is justiﬁed
is to run the equation on a disaggregated basis and then check whether the data
satisﬁes the aggregation step.
Consider the following speciﬁcation,
DDit ¼ a þ bDIVDIVt þ bIIt þ bWDWt  bCCt þ eit:
ð4Þ
Under the pecking order theory, it is DEFit itself that matters. A unit increase in any
of the components of DEFit must have the same unit impact on DDit: The pecking
order hypothesis is thus bDIV ¼ bI ¼ bW ¼ bC ¼ 1: If that hypothesis is correct, then
the aggregation in Eq. (1) is justiﬁed. If however, the signiﬁcance is actually only
driven by some of the individual components, then alternative coefﬁcient patterns
are possible.
2.2. Using other information to account for leverage
The pecking order test implicitly makes different exogeneity assumptions and uses
a different information set than is conventional in empirical research on leverage and
leverage-adjusting behavior. Harris and Raviv (1991) explain the conventional set of
variables and then Rajan and Zingales (1995) distill these variables into a simple
cross-sectional model.
The conventional set of explanatory factors for leverage is the conventional set for
a reason. The variables have survived many tests. As explained below, these variables
also have conventional interpretations. Excluding such variables from consideration
is therefore potentially a signiﬁcant omission. It is also true that including such
variables potentially poses a tough test for the pecking order theory.
The conventional leverage regression is intended to explain the level of leverage,
while the pecking order regression is intended to explain the change rather than the
level. As long as the shocks are uncorrelated across years, we can equally well run the
conventional speciﬁcation in ﬁrst differences. Of course, a lower R2 will be obtained.
The assumption of uncorrelated shocks is unlikely literally correct. When we run the
M.Z. Frank, V.K. Goyal / Journal of Financial Economics 67 (2003) 217–248
223
conventional regression in ﬁrst differences, we expect to lose some accuracy.
Running the conventional regression in ﬁrst differences may also bias the variable
coefﬁcients towards zero. It turns out that this bias is not large enough to alter our
conclusions about the relative empirical validity of the two approaches. The beneﬁt
is that we then have an appropriate speciﬁcation in which to nest the ﬁnancing deﬁcit
variable. Alternatively, one could run a regression that explains the level of leverage,
then use a cumulated past ﬁnancing deﬁcit variable to represent the pecking order. If
that is done there is an issue about when to start the cumulating. We try such a
procedure and obtain results that are very similar to those reported in Table 7.
At the heart of the conventional empirical analysis is a regression of leverage on
four factors: tangibility of assets (denoted T), market-to-book ratio (denoted MTB),
log sales (denoted LS), and proﬁtability (denoted P). Let D denote the ﬁrst
differences between years. Our version of the basic regression equation is therefore
DDi ¼ a þ bTDTi þ bMTBDMTBi þ bLSDLSi þ bPDPi þ bDEFDEFi þ ei:
ð5Þ
Eq. (5) is simply a conventional regression run in ﬁrst differences but with ﬁnancing
deﬁcit as an added factor. In the conventional regression, this term is not present.
From the perspective of testing the pecking order, the most important of the
conventional variables is tangibility. According to Harris and Raviv (1991), under
the pecking order theory, one might expect that ﬁrms with few tangible assets would
have greater asymmetric information problems. Thus, ﬁrms with few tangible assets
will tend to accumulate more debt over time and become more highly levered. Hence,
Harris and Raviv argue that the pecking order predicts that bTo0: This is not the
conventional prediction regarding the role of tangibility. A more common idea is
based on the hypothesis that collateral supports debt. It is often suggested that
tangible assets naturally serve as collateral. Hence, collateral is associated with
increased leverage. The usual prediction is that bT > 0:
Firms with high market-to-book ratios are often thought to have more future
growth opportunities. As in Myers (1977), there may be a concern that debt could
limit a ﬁrm’s ability to seize such opportunities when they appear. Goyal et al. (2002)
ﬁnd that when growth opportunities of defense ﬁrms decline, these ﬁrms increase
their use of debt ﬁnancing. Barclay et al. (2001) present a model showing that the
debt capacity of growth options can be negative. The common prediction is that
bMTBo0:
Large ﬁrms are usually more diversiﬁed, have better reputations in debt markets,
and face lower information costs when borrowing. Therefore, large ﬁrms are
predicted to have more debt in their capital structures. The prediction is that bLS > 0:
The predictions on proﬁtability are ambiguous. The tradeoff theory predicts that
proﬁtable ﬁrms should be more highly levered to offset corporate taxes. Also, in
many asymmetric information models, such as Ross (1977), proﬁtable ﬁrms are
predicted to have higher leverage. But Titman and Wessels (1988) and Fama and
French (2002) show that this is not a common ﬁnding. Instead, the literature ﬁnds
proﬁts and leverage to be negatively correlated. While MacKay and Phillips (2001)
challenge this common ﬁnding, we expect to ﬁnd that bPo0:
M.Z. Frank, V.K. Goyal / Journal of Financial Economics 67 (2003) 217–248
224
Fama and French (2002) note that the negative relationship between proﬁts and
leverage is consistent with the pecking order theory. But the pecking order is not the
only possible interpretation of the relationship. There are at least two issues. First,
current proﬁtability can also serve as a signal of investment opportunities. There is a
large macro-ﬁnance literature, including studies by Gilchrist and Himmelberg (1995)
and Kaplan and Zingales (1997), in which this interpretation issue plays a key role. It
is well known that it is difﬁcult to construct a convincing proxy for investment
opportunities. If Tobin’s q or the simpler measure, market-to-book assets, is
measured with error, then it may not adequately control for the information content
in a ﬁrm’s proﬁtability. For an analysis of measurement error in this context, see
Erickson and Whited (2000).
The second issue is that ﬁrms may face ﬁxed costs of adjustment. Fischer et al.
(1989) analyze the effect of having ﬁxed costs associated with actively adjusting
leverage. When a ﬁrm earns proﬁts, debt gets paid off and leverage falls
automatically. Only periodically will large readjustments be made in order to
capture the tax beneﬁts of leverage. Empirically, most of the data reﬂects the process
of paying off the debt by using proﬁts. Thus, proﬁtable ﬁrms will be less levered even
if the tradeoff theory is at work and the adjustment costs are taken into account.
3. Data
We need the data from funds ﬂow statements to test the pecking order theory. This
restricts the beginning of the sample period to 1971 since that is when American
ﬁrms started reporting funds ﬂow statements. The data ends with 1998. Variables are
deﬂated to constant 1992 dollars.
Following standard practice, ﬁnancial ﬁrms (6000–6999), regulated utilities (4900–
4999), and ﬁrms involved in major mergers (Compustat footnote code AB) are
excluded.2 Also excluded are ﬁrms with missing book value of assets and a small
number of ﬁrms that reported format codes 4, 5, or 6. Compustat does not deﬁne
format codes 4 and 6. Format code 5 is for the Canadian ﬁle. The balance sheet and
cash ﬂow statement variables as a percentage of assets are trimmed to remove the
most extreme 0.50% in either tail of the distribution. This serves to remove outliers
and the most extremely misrecorded data.3
The balance sheet presentation of corporate assets and liabilities is reasonably
consistent over time. Average common-size balance sheets for a number of years
between 1971 and 1998 are presented in Table 1. The asset side shows signiﬁcant
changes over time. Cash increases dramatically over the period, going from 5% to
2Leaving in the data on ﬁrms involved in major mergers had no material effect on our conclusions. We,
therefore, do not report these results separately.
3Prior to trimming, several balance sheet and cash ﬂow statement items are recoded as zero if they were
reported missing or combined with other data items in Compustat. The data is often coded as missing
when a ﬁrm does not report a particular item or combines it with other data items. After examining
accounting identities, we determine that recoding missing values on these items as zero respects the
reported accounting identities.

Table 1
Common-size balance sheet for US industrial ﬁrms
This table presents average balance sheets for US industrial ﬁrms for selected years. Financial ﬁrms and utilities are excluded. The value of each balance-sheet
item is calculated as a percentage of the book value of total assets and then averaged across each ﬁrm reporting data on Compustat in that year. When ﬁrms
report combined cash and short-term investments, we include these amounts with cash and recode short-term investments as zero. In addition, the following
items are recoded as zero when they were either missing or combined with other data items: investment and advances (#31 and #32), intangibles (#33), other
assets (#69), debt in current liabilities (#34), income taxes payable (#71), other current liabilities (#72), other liabilities (#75), deferred taxes and ITC (#35), and
minority interest (#38).

13% of total book assets. Intangibles double from 3.4% to 7.6% of the total assets.
At the same time, inventories, and property, plant, and equipment experience large
declines. In contrast to the assets side of the balance sheet, the liability side is quite
stable during this period.
American ﬁrms report their accounts in a number of different formats over the last
thirty years. To have a consistent time-series, we merge the different format codes to
a common format. The data from 1971 to 1987 is from the ‘‘Cash Statement by
Sources and Use of funds.’’ The standard form of reporting corporate cash ﬂows
changed in 1988. For ﬁscal years ending before July 15, 1988, there are three distinct
but closely related formats (Compustat format codes 1, 2, 3) that were permitted for
companies to report their cash ﬂows. Beginning in 1988, most ﬁrms start reporting
Statement of Cash Flows (format code 7). In the earlier period, the structure has
funds from operations plus other sources of funds minus uses of working capital
equals change in working capital. The cash ﬂows since July 15, 1988 are structured as
income plus indirect operating activities plus investing activities plus ﬁnancing
activities equals change in cash and cash equivalents. A disaggregated version of
these statements is fairly lengthy and is therefore relegated to Appendix A. The fact
that this statement is lengthy is itself important to recognize. It implies that when
testing the pecking order, a large number of separate elements are being aggregated.
It has been suggested that the pecking order hypothesis must be true empirically.
This is because it is ‘‘well known’’ that, to a ﬁrst approximation, ﬁrms do not issue
much equity after the IPO. If equity issues are known to be zero, then by the
accounting identity in Eq. (1), the ﬁnancing deﬁcit must be equal to the debt issue.
As shown in Table 2, this conjectured ﬁrst approximation to an accounting identity
is misleading. Much more equity is issued than is sometimes recognized.
Table 2 presents cash ﬂows in an aggregated form that matches Eq. (1). In this
table, the ﬁnancing deﬁcit grows over time. To a dramatic degree, net equity issues
grow at a faster rate than net debt issues. The number of public ﬁrms grows
signiﬁcantly over the period studied. Therefore, an obvious hypothesis is that the
magnitude of equity reﬂects a large number of IPOs. To check this, we remove the
data for each ﬁrm for the ﬁrst year that it appeared in Compustat. The results (not
reported) show that removing these observations has only a minor effect. The large
use of net equity is not merely an IPO effect.
Firm size and discreteness both play a role in understanding the evidence in Table
2. During the 1980s and especially the 1990s, a signiﬁcant inﬂux of small ﬁrms
became publicly traded. These small ﬁrms use relatively more equity ﬁnancing than
do large ﬁrms. Table 2 reports the mean values. Due to discreteness, there is a big
gap between the mean and the median debt and equity issues. The median net debt
issue and the median net equity issue are both close to zero despite the large mean
values. Apparently many ﬁrms remain out of both the debt and equity markets most
of the time. Occasionally, they enter these markets actively. The magnitudes of the
interventions are often large relative to the ﬁrm size.
While the tables provide snapshots in selected years, it is also helpful to consider
the year-by-year trends in the relative use of debt and equity. Fig. 1 shows the
changing roles of net debt and net equity relative to the ﬁnancing deﬁcit over assets

for the full 1971–1998 period. Because of the accounting cash ﬂow identity, it is
natural to expect that net debt and net equity ought to track the ﬁnancing deﬁcit.
Under the pecking order, one would expect that the debt would track the ﬁnancing
deﬁcit much more closely than would net equity. Empirically, the reverse is observed.
Adding the currently maturing debt to the ﬁnancing deﬁcit and omitting IPO ﬁrms
have only very minor impacts on the picture. The correlation between net equity and
the ﬁnancing deﬁcit is 0.80, while the correlation between the ﬁnancing deﬁcit and
net long-term debt is only 0.48.
The information reported in Table 2 and depicted in Fig. 1 conveys an important
message. According to Myers (2001) a major advantage of the pecking order is that it
explains why the bulk of external ﬁnancing takes the form of debt. What Table 2
shows is that this is empirically not observed. A great deal of external ﬁnancing takes
the form of equity. Graham (2000) shows that some ﬁrms use debt conservatively
and that these ﬁrms employ more equity than debt. The low debt levels employed by
some ﬁrms remain theoretically challenging. Minton and Wruck (2001) and

assets, 1971–1998. The ﬁgure plots annual averages of the ratios of ﬁnancing deﬁcit to net assets, net debt
issued to net assets, and net equity issued to net assets for the period between 1971 and 1998. The sample
comprises U.S. ﬁrms on the Compustat ﬁles. Financial ﬁrms and regulated utilities are excluded. The
ﬁnancing deﬁcit is calculated as cash dividends plus investments plus change in working capital minus
internal cash ﬂow. Net debt issued is long-term debt issuance minus long-term debt redemption. Net equity
issued is the issue of stock minus the repurchase of stock. The variables are constructed using data from
Compustat funds-ﬂow statements.

Lemmon and Zender (2001) provide further evidence. In many years more equity
than debt is used on average.
A second important aspect of Table 2 concerns the importance of retained
earnings relative to external ﬁnancing. According to Myers (2001), typically most
investment is ﬁnanced by internal cash ﬂow. Table 2 shows that during the 1980s and
1990s, this is not the typical pattern. Over time, the internal cash ﬂow declines in
relative importance as a source of ﬁnancing.
4. Empirical tests
Shyam-Sunder and Myers (1999) study data from the period 1971 to 1989. Results
are presented separately for their sample period (1971–1989) and for subsequent
years (1990–1998) for many speciﬁcations. This facilitates comparisons.
Table 3 provides the results of regressions for the same time period as Shyam-
Sunder and Myers (1999). We follow their approach of reporting results separately
for net debt issued, gross debt issued, and the change in the debt ratio. We also
attempt to match their sample selection criteria. The most signiﬁcant of their criteria
is the requirement that ﬁrms report continuously on the necessary variables. These
criteria result in a sample with 768 ﬁrms and 19 years of data for each ﬁrm. This is
signiﬁcantly larger than their sample of 157 ﬁrms.
Many other restrictions are tried. Examples include requiring ﬁrms to report
continuously on a variety of other variables or only considering ﬁrms for inclusion
based on speciﬁc Compustat format codes. Adding more restrictions does result in
sample sizes becoming smaller. However, we did not manage to exactly identify their
157 ﬁrms. These further restrictions lead to samples for which the empirical results
are very similar to those reported in Table 3. We therefore place minimum
restrictions consistent with our understanding of the treatment of data in their paper.
The results in Table 3 start with net debt issued as the dependent variable in a
sample of ﬁrms with no gaps permitted. Despite the differences in sample size, we do
replicate the coefﬁcients on the ﬁnancing deﬁcit reported by Shyam-Sunder and
Myers (1999). As reported in column (1) of Table 3, the estimated coefﬁcient for this
sample is 0.75 and the R2 is 0.71. Support for the pecking order theory is strong in
this case. The ﬁndings for gross debt and change in debt ratio departs somewhat
from their results.
For the holdout sample R2s, there is a choice of whether to use the same restricted
set of ﬁrms or instead to examine the broader population of ﬁrms. It is not a case of
one being right and the other being wrong. These two alternatives provide different
information about what the ﬁtted equation tells us. The full sample holdout test
shows whether the ﬁtted model accounts for the broad population of ﬁrms that exist
over the subsequent ﬁve years. The restricted sample holdout test shows whether the
ﬁtted model accounts for the debt issuing decisions of the surviving members of the
selected sample over the next ﬁve years. The attrition rate among the selected sample
of ﬁrms is rather high in the next ﬁve years. For the survivors, the predictability is
very good. Of course, the pecking order theory does not predict which ﬁrms will

The sample period is 1971–1989. Financial ﬁrms and utilities are excluded. The sample in columns (1)–(3) additionally excludes ﬁrms with gaps in reporting of
relevant ﬂow of funds data. The following regression is estimated: DDit ¼ a þ bPODEFit þ eit; where DDt is the net or gross amount of debt issued, and the

in long-term debt to net assets ratio. The holdout sample period is from 1990 to 1994. Standard errors are reported in parentheses.

survive. For the broader population of ﬁrms, the predictability is poor. The full
population out-of-sample results show that the model results do not generalize.
There is nothing in the pecking order theory that requires the use of balanced
panels of ﬁrms. Comparison of columns (1)–(3) with columns (4)–(6) shows that
requiring ﬁrms to have no reporting gaps has a nontrivial impact on the results. Both
the estimated coefﬁcient on the ﬁnancing deﬁcit, and the R2; decline sharply when we
examine the broader population of U.S. ﬁrms over the period 1971–1989. As column
(4) of Table 3 shows, the coefﬁcient on ﬁnancing deﬁcit in the net debt issued
regression is 0.28 with an R2 of 0.27. The results from regressions that explain gross
debt issued and change in debt ratio as a function of ﬁnancing deﬁcit similarly show
substantial declines in both coefﬁcient estimates and R2s when the focus shifts from
the 768 ﬁrm sample that traded continuously to the broader population of publicly
traded U.S. ﬁrms.4
How did the ﬁrms with no gaps in the reporting of funds ﬂow data differ from the
broader population? The 768 ﬁrms that reported continuously during 1971–1989
were large. Their book value of assets is almost twice that of the broader population
of ﬁrms. These ﬁrms also issue signiﬁcantly higher amounts of debt and signiﬁcantly
lower amounts of equity. The R2 on the hold out samples show that ﬁtted equations
from the period 1971–1989 have a very limited ability to forecast leverage behavior
during the next ﬁve years.
Are the results speciﬁc to a particular time period? To address this question,
Table 4 uses the data from the 1990s and initially requires the included ﬁrms to report
continuous data on the ﬂow of funds. We then relax the continuous reporting criteria
to examine whether the results are sensitive to the period, the requirement that ﬁrms
report continuous funds ﬂow data or both. The coefﬁcient estimates and the R2s are
now uniformly lower, even when we require that ﬁrms have no reporting gaps.
During 1990–1998 the no-reporting-gap ﬁrms were large equity issuers. The
average ratio of net equity issued to net assets was 0.033 and the average ratio of net
debt issued over net assets was 0.008. Thus, we see that time period plays a major
role. Comparing Table 3 to Table 4 shows that support for the pecking order theory
was weaker in the 1990s.
4.1. Disaggregating the ﬁnancing deﬁcit
The aggregation step embodied in the pecking order is a nontrivial imposition of
structure on the data. Is that structure justiﬁed empirically? Table 5 reports
disaggregated deﬁcit component regressions for the earlier period.
4We tried a great many additional variations to see if greater support could be found for the pecking
order theory. To save space, we do not report the details of most of these variations. We tried different
ways of constructing the deﬁcit variable. We experimented with including current maturities of long-term
debt at the beginning of period to the deﬁcit variable. We also experimented with excluding changes in
cash and changes in current debt from the change in working capital. In every case, the magnitude of the
estimated coefﬁcient and the R2 appeared marginally worse, without affecting our overall conclusion. We
also examined a simple deﬁcit variable that excludes extraordinary and non-operating ﬂows. As expected,
the estimated coefﬁcients and R2s worsen signiﬁcantly.

Column (1) in Table 5 is relatively supportive of the pecking order aggrega-
tion step. If this column is examined in isolation, one could conclude that the
evidence, while rejecting aggregation, is actually reasonably favorable to the theory.
However, this result is a function of the requirement that ﬁrms have no gaps in funds
ﬂow data over the entire period from 1971 to 1989. When we include ﬁrms that do
not have complete records (in columns (4)–(7)), the sample becomes much larger and
the observed coefﬁcients change dramatically. During the 1990s, the evidence moves
further away from supporting the pecking order aggregation hypothesis.
How should we interpret the coefﬁcients on the components of the ﬁnancing
deﬁcit? We start with cash dividends. Table 5 shows that when net debt issues are
considered the coefﬁcient on cash dividends is positive, but when gross debt issues
are considered it is negative. This stems from the fact that dividend-paying ﬁrms
issue less long-term debt but they also redeem less when compared to non-dividend
paying ﬁrms. It is worth noting that the tradeoff theory also predicts a positive
relation between dividends and debt. High dividend paying ﬁrms are likely to be
those that expect to continue to generate large cash ﬂows and have small investment
needs in relation to cash ﬂows.
The pecking order theory predicts a positive sign and a unit coefﬁcient on
investments in both ﬁxed assets and working capital. According to the theory, after
controlling for internal cash ﬂows, investments in ﬁxed assets and working capital
should be matched dollar for dollar by increases in debt issues. But this is not the
only idea. The tradeoff theory also predicts a positive relation between investments
and debt. Higher investments add to assets in place, increasing tangible assets. This
increases debt capacity. The positive relation between changes in working capital
and net debt issues might also reﬂect timing issues. If a ﬁrm issues long-term debt
then it receives cash. Until the ﬁrm spends that cash, it can be put into bank accounts
or other short-term investments that are included in working capital.
At the typical ﬁrm, internal cash ﬂow does lead to some reduction in debt issues,
but the magnitude of the effect is surprisingly small once one includes the behavior of
ﬁrms that do not have complete trading records. There is a large literature showing a
negative relation between leverage and proﬁtability. However, as noted earlier, if
internal cash ﬂow measures future growth opportunities, then the tradeoff theory
also predicts the observed negative relation on cash ﬂows.
In column (7) of Table 5, the current portion of long-term debt is added as a
further explanatory variable. As previously discussed, Shyam-Sunder and Myers
(1999) include the current portion of long-term debt as a component of the ﬁnancing
deﬁcit. The ﬁnancing deﬁcit variable studied in this paper does not include it.
Column (7) illustrates why it was dropped. The sign is negative and the magnitude is
fairly small. This is not at all what is predicted by the pecking order theory. This
evidence is consistent with a model in which transaction costs play a signiﬁcant role.
When long-term debt comes due, it is not automatically replaced with new debt.
4.2. A priori selection criteria for pecking order ﬁrms
The evidence presented so far has shown that the pecking order theory does not
account for the broad patterns in the ﬁnancing of American ﬁrms. This does not rule
M.Z. Frank, V.K. Goyal / Journal of Financial Economics 67 (2003) 217–248
236
out the possibility that some ﬁrms have the hypothesized unit slope coefﬁcient in
Eq. (2). The theory suggests looking for ﬁrms prone to adverse selection problems.
Table 3 suggests looking at large ﬁrms.
The pecking order theory is based on a difference of information between
corporate insiders and the market. The driving force is adverse selection.
Accordingly, it is natural to examine ﬁrms that are commonly thought to be
particularly subject to adverse selection problems, such as small ﬁrms and high-
growth ﬁrms. Table 6 shows that the evidence strongly rejects this hypothesis. The
pecking order performs much worse for these ﬁrms. This evidence is consistent with
Helwege and Liang (1996), who study a sample of ﬁrms that had an IPO in 1983, and
thus were fairly small on average. Helwege and Liang (1996) ﬁnd that the use of
external ﬁnancing by these ﬁrms did not match the pecking order prediction.
Since small ﬁrms do not generally follow the pecking order, consideration next
turns to large ﬁrms. Consideration is also given to ﬁrms that are likely to have less
severe adverse selection problems, such as ﬁrms paying dividends and ﬁrms with
moderate leverage. The results show that the pecking order theory does in fact
perform much better for large ﬁrms. Neither moderate leverage nor the payment of
dividends substitutes for the effect of ﬁrm size.
This evidence shows that ﬁrm size is critical.5 There is a monotonic improvement
of the performance of the pecking order predictions as the ﬁrm size increases. For the
largest quartile, there is reasonable support for the pecking order prediction. For the
smallest set of ﬁrms, the pecking order is rejected. In the middle, the support for the
theory grows with ﬁrm size.
Overall, the results based on data from the period 1971–1989 show that the
smallest ﬁrms do not follow the pecking order, but the largest ﬁrms do, and the
medium size categories are somewhat pecking order-like over this time period. There
is strong evidence that at least some aspects of the ﬁnancing patterns have changed
over time. Does this have an effect on the interpretation of the role of ﬁrm size?
The last four columns of Table 6 provide evidence from the period 1990–1998.
Support for the pecking order declines signiﬁcantly. During the 1990s, it is only the
top quartile of ﬁrms that are at all supportive. Even for the top quartile of ﬁrms, the
numerical coefﬁcients move further from the pecking order predictions. In columns
(5) and (6) the holdout sample predictions are considerably poorer than the in
sample R2 would suggest. This is consistent with the evidence in columns (9) and (10)
showing that corporate-debt-issuing behavior changes during the 1990s. This shows
that, in addition to ﬁrm size, the time period also matters for the tests of the pecking
order. Large ﬁrms in earlier decades are most supportive of the pecking order theory,
while smaller, high-growth ﬁrms provide the strongest rejections of the theory.
Support for pecking order declines even for larger ﬁrms in the 1990s.
The results on large ﬁrms match well with the results from the survey of ﬁnancial
managers carried out by Graham and Harvey (2001). They report that some
5We treat ﬁrm size as exogenous. This is quite common in corporate ﬁnance studies. Of course, there is a
deeper level of consideration at which ﬁrm size itself might be explained. Kumar et al. (2001) study some
aspects of this question.

Table 6
Pecking order tests for sub-samples of small and large ﬁrms
Firms are sorted into quartiles based on total assets. The table presents pecking order tests on ﬁrms that pay strictly positive dividends, ﬁrms with moderate
leverage, and high-growth ﬁrms. Moderate leverage is deﬁned by the omission of the top two and bottom two deciles. High growth ﬁrms are those with a
market-to-book ratio in excess of the 75th percentile of the distribution. The following regression is estimated: DDit ¼ a þ bPODEFit þ eit; where DDt ¼ the
amount of net debt issued, and DEFt is the sum of dividends, investment, change in working capital (change in working capital+change in cash+change in
short term debt), minus the cash ﬂow after interest and taxes. All variables are scaled by net assets. Standard errors are reported in parentheses.

ﬁnancial managers expressed views similar to the pecking order, but apparently not
due to adverse selection.
4.3. Conventional leverage regressions
Even if a theory is wrong, it could still be helpful if it does a better job of
accounting for the evidence than competing theories. The pecking order is a
competitor to more conventional empirical leverage speciﬁcations. Accordingly, the
next test of the theory is to see how the ﬁnancing deﬁcit works when added to a
conventional leverage regression. To provide a suitable structure to nest both the
pecking order theory and the conventional variables, the regressions are run in ﬁrst
differences. As explained in Section 2.2, ﬁrst differences can bias the conventional
variables towards zero. The dependent variable in these regressions is the change in
market leverage. Using book leverage yields similar results.
Table 7 presents the results. The estimated coefﬁcients on the market-to-book
assets ratio, tangibility, ﬁrm size, and proﬁtability have the usual signs. The
coefﬁcient signs are negative on the market-to-book ratio, positive on tangibility,
positive on log of sales, and negative on proﬁtability.
In column (2), the leverage regression is estimated with ﬁnancing deﬁcit as an
additional explanatory variable. If the pecking order were the key driver, it should
have wiped out the effects of the conventional variables. It did not do so. Adding the
deﬁcit variable to the regression did not have much effect on the magnitudes and
signiﬁcance of the coefﬁcients on the conventional variables. However, the ﬁnancing
deﬁcit is empirically relevant.
In column (3), the leverage regressions are re-estimated with lagged leverage as an
additional explanatory variable. The coefﬁcient on lagged leverage is fairly large in
magnitude and statistically signiﬁcant. The negative sign on lagged leverage suggests
that mean reversion is at work as predicted by the tradeoff theory. Inclusion of
lagged leverage does not affect the sign and signiﬁcance of most of the other
variables in the regression.
While the pecking order theory is rejected, this does not mean that the ﬁnancing
deﬁcit is ignored. As shown in columns (4)–(9), the information contained in the
ﬁnancing deﬁcit appears to be factored in, along with many other considerations,
particularly when large ﬁrms adjust leverage. But as shown in column (8) of Table 7,
even for the largest set of ﬁrms, it is easy to reject the hypothesized unit coefﬁcient on
the ﬁnancing deﬁcit.
It is interesting to consider the R2 on the hold out samples. Adding the ﬁnancing
deﬁcit and adding lagged leverage adds remarkably little to the performance of the
ﬁtted equations once account is taken of the conventional factors. This is consistent
with Fama and French (2002) who argue that mean reversion in corporate leverage is
surprisingly weak.
Most studies report on levels of leverage rather than on changes in leverage.
Accordingly, for completeness, we also estimate analogous regressions run in levels.
The results (omitted in order to save space) show that the cumulative ﬁnancing
deﬁcit added about 1% to the explanatory power of the regressions. The estimated

coefﬁcients on the conventional variables had the usual signs including positive on
tangibility, negative on the market-to-book assets, positive on log of sales, and
negative on proﬁtability. In this case, lagged leverage is signiﬁcant and has a positive
sign. It also has a signiﬁcant impact both within sample and in the hold out sample.
5. Conclusions
The pecking order theory is tested on a broad cross-section of publicly traded
American ﬁrms over the period 1971–1998. In contrast to what is often suggested,
internal ﬁnancing is not sufﬁcient to cover investment spending on average. External
ﬁnancing is heavily used. Debt ﬁnancing does not dominate equity ﬁnancing in
magnitude. Net equity issues track the ﬁnancing deﬁcit quite closely, while net debt does
not do so. The current portion of long-term debt is not treated as part of the ﬁnancing
deﬁcit. These facts are surprising from the perspective of the pecking order theory.
The pecking order theory is a competitor to the conventional leverage regressions.
It is thus important to examine the relative importance of the two approaches. In
speciﬁcations that nest the two approaches, the ﬁnancing deﬁcit adds a small amount
of extra explanatory power. But the ﬁnancing deﬁcit does not challenge the role of
the conventional leverage factors.
When narrower samples of ﬁrms are considered the greatest support for the
pecking order is found among large ﬁrms in earlier years. Over time, support for the
pecking order declines for two reasons. More small ﬁrms are publicly traded during
the 1980s and 1990s than during the 1970s. Since small ﬁrms do not follow the
pecking order, the overall average moves further from the pecking order. However,
the time period effect is not entirely due to more small ﬁrms in the 1990s. Even when
attention is restricted to the largest quartile of ﬁrms, support for the pecking order
theory declines over time. Equity becomes more important.
Many aspects of the evidence pose serious problems for the pecking order. But this
does not mean that the information contained in the ﬁnancing deﬁcit is completely
irrelevant. The components of the ﬁnancing deﬁcit appear factored in to some
degree, particularly by large ﬁrms, when they adjust their leverage.

This table presents average cash ﬂow statement for US industrial ﬁrms for selected years. The data is from Compustat. For years up to and including 1985
Compustat format codes 1, 2, and 3 are used. Starting in year 1990 format code 7 is used. These formats have different standard presentations. We have
followed format 7 to the extent possible. Financial ﬁrms and utilities are excluded. Also excluded are ﬁrms involved in major mergers. The value of each
income statement and cash ﬂow item is expressed as a fraction of total assets for each ﬁrm and then averaged across ﬁrms. Other fund from operation
aggregates extraordinary items, deferred tax, equity in net loss, loss (gain) on sale of PPE and sale of investments, and funds from operations—other.

Table 9
The sample period is 1971–1998 Financial ﬁrms and utilities are excluded.
The variables are as follows (Compustat data item numbers in parentheses). Book value of assets is total assets (#6). Sales is net sales (12). Book value of debt is
the sum of debt in current liabilities (#34) plus long-term debt (#9). Dividend is cash dividend (#127). Capital investments is capital expenditures (#128) +
increase in investments (#113) + acquisitions (#129) + other use of funds (#219)  sale of PPE (#107)  sale of investment (#109). Change in working capital
is the working capital change-other (#236) plus change in cash (#274) plus change in short term debt (#301). Internal cash ﬂow is income before extraordinary
items (#123) plus depreciation and amortization (#124) and some other extraordinary ﬂows. Financing deﬁcit is dividend, plus investments, plus change in
working capital minus operating cash ﬂow after interest and taxes. Net debt issued is issuance of long-term debt (#111) minus reduction of long-term debt
(#114). Net equity issued is sale of common stock (#108) minus purchase of common stock (#115). Book leverage is deﬁned as the ratio of book value of debt
divided by book debt plus book equity.
