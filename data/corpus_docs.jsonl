Given this assumption, the theorist has\nconcluded that the cost of capital to the owners of a firm is simply the\nrate of interest on bonds; and has derived the familiar proposition that\nthe firm, acting rationally, will tend to push investmnent to the point\n* The authors are, respectively, professor and associate professor of economics in the Grad-\nuate School of Industrial Administration, Carnegie Institute of Technology. This article is a\nrevised version of a paper delivered at the annual meeting of the Econometric Society, Decem-\nber 1956. The authors express thanks for the comments and suggestions made at that time\nby the discussants of the paper, Evsey Domar, Robert Eisner and John Lintner, and subse-\nquently by J'ames Duesenberry. They are also greatly indebted to many of their present and\nformer colleagues and students at Carnegie Tech who served so often and with such remark-\nable patience as a critical forum for the ideas here presented.\n1 The literature bearing on the cost-of-capital problem is far too extensive for listing here.\nNumerous references to it will be found throughout the paper though we make no claim to\ncompleteness. One phase of the problem which we do not consider explicitly, but which has a\nconsiderable literature of its own is the relation between the cost of capital and public utility\nrates. For a recent summary of the \"cost-of-capital theory\" of rate regulation and a brief dis-\ncussion of some of its implications, the reader may refer to H. M. Somers [201.\n262\nTHE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\nwhere the marginal yield on physical assets is equal to the market rate\nof interest.2 This proposition can be shown to follow from either of two\ncriteria of rational decision-making which are equivalent under certain-\nty, namely (1) the maximization of profits and (2) the maximization of\nmarket value.\nAccording to the first criterion, a physical asset is worth acquiring if\nit will increase the net profit of the owners of the firm. But net profit\nwill increase only if the expected rate of return, or yield, of the asset\nexceeds the rate of interest. According to the second criterion, an asset\nis worth acquiring if it increases the value of the owners' equity, i.e., if\nit adds more to the market value of the firm than the costs of acquisi-\ntion. But what the asset adds is given by capitalizing the stream it gen-\nerates at the market rate of interest, and this capitalized value will\nexceed its cost if and only if the yield of the asset exceeds the rate of\ninterest. Note that, under either formulation, the cost of capital is equal\nto the rate of interest on bonds, regardless of whether the funds are\nacquired through debt instruments or through new issues of common\nstock. Indeed, in a world of sure returns, the distinction between debt\nand equity funds reduces largely to one of terminology.\nIt must be acknowledged that some attempt is usually made in this\ntype of analysis to allow for the existence of uncertainty. This attempt\ntypically takes the form of superimposing on the results of the certainty\nanalysis the notion of a \"risk discount\" to be subtracted from the ex-\npected yield (or a \"risk premium\" to be added to the market rate of\ninterest). Investment decisions are then supposed to be based on a com-\nparison of this \"risk adjusted\" or \"certainty equivalent\" yield with the\nmarket rate of interest.3 No satisfactory explanation has yet been pro-\nvided, however, as to what determines the size of the risk discount and\nhow it varies in response to changes in other variables.\nConsidered as a convenient approximation, the model of the firm\nconstructed via this certainty-or certainty-equivalent-approach has\nadmittedly been useful in dealing with some of the grosser aspects of\nthe processes of capital accumulation and economic fluctuations. Such\na model underlies, for example, the familiar Keynesian aggregate invest-\nment function in which aggregate investment is written as a function of\nthe rate of interest-the same riskless rate of interest which appears\nlater in the system in the liquidity-preference equation. Yet few would\nmaintain that this approximation is adequate. At the macroeconomic\nlevel there are ample grounds for doubting that the rate of interest has\n2 Or, more accurately, to the marginal cost of borrowed funds since it is customary, at least\nin advanced analysis, to draw the supply curve of borrowed funds to the firm as a rising one.\nFor an advanced treatment of the certainty case, see F. and V. Lutz [131.\na The classic examples of the certainty-equivalent approach are found in J. R. Hicks [8] and\n0. Lange [11].\nMODIGLIANI AND MILLER: THEORY OF INVESTMENT\n263\nas large and as direct an influence on the rate of investment as this\nanalysis would lead us to believe. At the microeconomic level the cer-\ntainty model has little descriptive value and provides no real guidance\nto the finance specialist or managerial economist whose main problems\ncannot be treated in a framework which deals so cavalierly with uncer-\ntainty and ignores all forms of financing other than debt issues.4\nOnly recently have economists begun to face up seriously to the prob-\nlem of the cost of capital cum risk. In the process they have found their\ninterests and endeavors merging with those of the finance specialist and\nthe managerial economist who have lived with the problem longer and\nmore intimately. In this joint search to establish the principles which\ngovern rational investment and financial policy in a world of uncer-\ntainty two main lines of attack can be discerned. These lines represent,\nin effect, attempts to extrapolate to the world of uncertainty each of the\ntwo criteria-profit maximization and market value maximization-\nwhich were seen to have equivalent implications in the special case of\ncertainty. With the recognition of uncertainty this equivalence vanishes.\nIn fact, the profit maximization criterion is no longer even well defined.\nUnder uncertainty there corresponds to each decision of the firm not a\nunique profit outcome, but a plurality of mutually exclusive outcomes\nwhich can at best be described by a subjective probability distribution.\nThe profit outcome, in short, has become a random variable and as such\nits maximization no longer has an operational meaning. Nor can this\ndifficulty generally be disposed of by using the mathematical expecta-\ntion of profits as the variable to be maximized. For decisions which\naffect the expected value will also tend to affect the dispersion and other\ncharacteristics of the distribution of outcomes. In particular, the use of\ndebt rather than equity funds to finance a given venture may well in-\ncrease the expected return to the owners, but only at the cost of in-\ncreased dispersion of the outcomes.\nUnder these conditions the profit outcomes of alternative investment\nand financing decisions can be compared and ranked only in terms of a\nsubjective \"utility function\" of the owners which weighs the expected\nyield against other characteristics of the distribution. Accordingly, the\nextrapolation of the profit maximization criterion of the certainty model\nhas tended to evolve into utility maximization, sometimes explicitly,\nmore frequently in a qualitative and heuristic form.5\nThe utility approach undoubtedly represents an advance over the\ncertainty or certainty-equivalent approach. It does at least permit us\n4 Those who have taken a \"case-method\" couirse in finance in recent years will recall in this\nconnection the famous Liquigas case of Hunt and Williams, 19, pp. 193-961 a case which is\noften used to introduce the student to the cost-of-capital problem and to poke a bit of fun at\nthe economist's certainty-model.\n6 For an attempt at a rigorous explicit development of this line of attack, see F. Modigliani\nand M. Zeman [141.\n264\nTHE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\nto explore (within limits) some of the implications of different financing\narrangements, and it does give some meaning to the \"cost\" of different\ntypes of funds. However, because the cost of capital has become an\nessentially subjective concept, the utility approach has serious draw-\nbacks for normative as well as analytical purposes. How, for example,\nis management to ascertain the risk preferences of its stockholders and\nto compromise among their tastes? And how can the economist build a\nmeaningful investment function in the face of the fact that any given\ninvestment opportunity might or might not be worth exploiting depend-\ning on precisely who happen to be the owners of the firm at the moment?\nFortunately, these questions do not have to be answered; for the alter-\nnative approach, based on market value maximization, can provide the\nbasis for an operational definition of the cost of capital and a workable\ntheory of investment. Under this approach any investment project and\nits concomitant financing plan must pass only the following test: Will\nthe project, as financed, raise the market value of the firm's shares? If\nso, it is worth undertaking; if not, its return is less than the marginal\ncost of capital to the firm. Note that such a test is entirely independent\nof the tastes of the current owners, since market prices will reflect not\nonly their preferences but those of all potential owners as well. If any\ncurrent stockholder disagrees with management and the market over\nthe valuation of the project, he is free to sell out and reinvest elsewhere,\nbut will still benefit from the capital appreciation resulting from man-\nagement's decision.\nThe potential advantages of the market-value approach have long\nbeen appreciated; yet analytical results have been meager. What ap-\npears to be keeping this line of development from achieving its promise\nis largely the lack of an adequate theory of the effect of financial struc-\nture on market valuations, and of how these effects can be inferred from\nobjective market data. It is with the development of such a theory and\nof its implications for the cost-of-capital problem that we shall be con-\ncerned in this paper.\nOur procedure will be to develop in Section I the basic theory itself\nand to give some brief account of its empirical relevance. In Section II,\nwe show how the theory can be used to answer the cost-of-capital ques-\ntion and how it permits us to develop a theory of investment of the\nfirm under conditions of uncertainty. Throughout these sections the\napproach is essentially a partial-equilibrium one focusing on the firm\nand \"industry.\" Accordingly, the \"prices\" of certain income streams\nwill be treated as constant and given from outside the model, just as in\nthe standard Marshallian analysis of the firm and industry the prices of\nall inputs and of all other products are taken as given. We have chosen\nto focus at this level rather than on the economy as a whole because it\nMODIGLIANI AND MILLER: THEORY OF INVESTMENT\n265\nis at the level of the firm and the industry that the interests of the vari-\nous specialists concerned with the cost-of-capital problem come most\nclosely together. Although the emphasis has thus been placed on partial-\nequilibrium analysis, the results obtained also provide the essential\nbuilding blocks for a general equilibrium model which shows how those\nprices which are here taken as given, are themselves determined. For\nreasons of space, however, and because the material is of interest in its\nown right, the presentation of the general equilibrium model which\nrounds out the analysis must be deferred to a subsequent paper.\nI. Tihe Valuation of Securities, Leverage, and tihe Cost of Capital\nA. T'he Capitalization Rate for Uncertain Streams\nAs a starting point, consider an economy in which all physical assets\nare owned by corporations. For the moment, assume that these corpora-\ntions can finance their assets by issuing common stock only; the intro-\nduction of bond issues, or their equivalent, as a source of corporate funds\nis postponed until the next part of this section.\nThe physical assets held by each firm will yield to the owners of the\nfirm-its stockholders-a stream of \"profits\" over time; but the ele-\nments of this series need not be constant and in any event are uncertain.\nThis stream of income, and hence the stream accruing to any share of\ncommon stock, will be regarded as extending indefinitely into the future.\nWTe assume, however, that the mean value of the stream over time, or\naverage profit per unit of time, is finite and represents a random vari-\nable subject to a (subjective) probability distribution. We shall refer to\nthe average value over time of the stream accruing to a given share as\nthe return of that share; and to the mathematical expectation of this\naverage as the expected return of the share.6 Although individual inves-\ntors may have different views as to the shape of the probability distri\n6 These propositions can be restated analytically as follows: The assets of the ith firm gener-\nate a stream:\nXi (I), Xi (2) ...\nXi (T)\nwhose elements are random variables subject to the joint probability distribution:\nXi [Xi (1), Xi (2) .. *X\\i (t)J.\nThe return to the ith firm is defined as:\nliT\nXi-=\nlim -\nXsit).\n7--co T t=\nXi is itself a random variable with a probability distribution diW(Xi)\nwhose form is determined\nuniquely by Xi. The expected return Xi is defined as Xi=E(Xi) =fxXib(X,)dX;.\nIf Ni is\nthe number of shares outstanding, the return of the ith share is xi= (1/N)X; with probability\ndistribution Oi(xi)dx1=4i(Nxi)d(Nxi) and expected value 9i=(1/N)X,.\n266\nTHE AMERICAN ECONOMIC\nREVIEW\nbution of the return of any share, we shall assume for simplicity that\nthey are at least in agreement as to the expected return.7\nThis way of characterizing uncertain streams merits brief comment.\nNotice first that the stream is a stream of profits, not dividends. As will\nbecome clear later, as long as management is presumed to be acting in\nthe best interests of the stockholders, retained earnings can be regarded\nas equivalent to a fully subscribed, pre-emptive issue of common stock.\nHence, for present purposes, the division of the stream between cash\ndividends and retained earnings in any period is a mere detail. Notice\nalso that the uncertainty attaches to the mean value over time of the\nstream of profits and should not be confused with variability over time\nof the successive elements of the stream. That variability and uncer-\ntainty are two totally different concepts should be clear from the fact\nthat the elements of a stream can be variable even though known with\ncertainty. It can be shown, furthermore, that whether the elements of a\nstream are sure or uncertain, the effect of variability per se on the valua-\ntion of the stream is at best a second-order one which can safely be neg-\nlected for our purposes (and indeed most others too).8\nThe next assumption plays a strategic role in the rest of the analysis.\nWe shall assume that firms can be divided into \"equivalent return\"\nclasses such that the return on the shares issued by any firm in any\ngiven class is proportional to (and hence perfectly correlated with) the\nreturn on the shares issued by any other firm in the same class. This\nassumption implies that the various shares within the same class differ,\nat most, by a \"scale factor.\" Accordingly, if we adjust for the difference\nin scale, by taking the ratio of the return to the expected return, the\nprobability distribution of that ratio is identical for all shares in the\nclass. It follows that all relevant properties of a share are uniquely char-\nacterized by specifying (1) the class to which it belongs and (2) its\nexpected return.\nThe significance of this assumption is that it permits us to classify\nfirms into groups within which the shares of different firms are \"homoge-\nneous,\" that is, perfect substitutes for one another. We have, thus, an\nanalogue to the familiar concept of the industry in which it is the com-\nmodity produced by the firms that is taken as homogeneous. To com-\nplete this analogy with Marshallian price theory, we shall assume in the\n7To deal adequately with refinements such as differences among investors in estimates of\nexpected returns would require extensive discussion of the theory of portfolio selection. Brief\nreferences to these and related topics will be made in the succeeding article on the general\nequilibrium model.\n8 The reader may convince himself of this by asking how much he would be willing to rebate\nto his employer for the privilege of receiving his annual salary in equal monthly installments\nrather than in irregular amounts over the year. See also J. M. Keynes [10, esp. pp. 53-541.\nMODIGLIANI AND MILLER: THEORY OF INVESTMENT\n267\nanalysis to follow that the shares concerned are traded in perfect mar-\nkets under conditions of atomistic competition.9\nFrom our definition of homogeneous classes of stock it follows that\nin equilibrium in a perfect capital market the price per dollar's worth of\nexpected return must be the same for all shares of any given class. Or,\nequivalently, in any given class the price of every share must be propor-\ntional to its expected return. Let us denote this factor of proportionality\nfor any class, say the kth class, by l/Pk. Then if pi denotes the price and\nsj is the expected return per share of the jth firm in class k, we must\nhave:\n(1)\npj =-xj;\nPk\nor, equivalently,\n(2)\n=\nPk a constant for all firms j in class k.\npi\nThe constants Pk (one for each of the k classes) can be given several\neconomic interpretations: (a) From (2) we see that each Pk iS the ex-\npected rate of return of any share in class k. (b) From (1) l/Pk is the\nprice which an investor has to pay for a dollar's worth of expected re-\nturn in the class k. (c) Again from (1), by analogy with the terminology\nfor perpetual bonds, Pk can be regarded as the market rate of capitaliza-\ntion for the expected value of the uncertain streams of the kind gen-\nerated by the kth class of firms.10\nB. Debt Financing and Its Effects on Security Prices\nHaving developed an apparatus for dealing with uncertain streams\nwe can now approach the heart of the cost-of-capital problem by drop-\nping the assumption that firms cannot issue bonds. The introduction of\ndebt-financing changes the market for shares in a very fundamental\nway. Because firms may have different proportions of debt in their capi-\n9 Just what our classes of stocks contain and how the different classes can be identified by\noutside observers are empirical questions to which we shall return later. For the present, it is\nsufficient to observe: (1) Our concept of a class, while not identical to that of the industry is\nat least closely related to it. Certainly the basic characteristics of the probability distributions\nof the returns on assets will depend to a significant extent on the product sold and the tech-\nnology used. (2) What are the appropriate class boundaries will depend on the particular prob-\nlem being studied. An economist concerned with general tendencies in the market, for example,\nmight well be prepared to work with far wider classes than would be appropriate for an inves-\ntor planning his portfolio, or a firm planning its financial strategy.\n10 We cannot, on the basis of the assumptions so far, make any statements about the rela-\ntionship or spread between the various p's or capitalization rates. Before we could do so we\nwould have to make further specific assumptions about the way investors believe the proba-\nbility distributions vary from class to class, as well as assumptions about investors' preferences\nas between the characteristics of different distributions.\n268\nTHE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\ntal structure, shares of different companies, even in the same class, can\ngive rise to different probability distributions of returns. In the language\nof finance, the shares will be subject to different degrees of filancial risk\nor \"leverage\" and hence they will no longer be perfect substitutes for\none another.\nTo exhibit the mechanism determining the relative prices of shares\nunder these conditions, we make the following two assumptions about\nthe nature of bonds and the bond market, though they are actually\nstronger than is necessary and will be relaxed later: (1) All bonds (in-\ncluding any debts issued by households for the purpose of carrying\nshares) are assumed to yield a constant income per unit of time, and\nthis income is regarded as certain by all traders regardless of the issuer.\n(2) Bonds, like stocks, are traded in a perfect market, where the term\nperfect is to be taken in its usual sense as implying that any two com-\nmodities which are perfect substitutes for each other must sell, in equi-\nlibrium, at the same price. It follows from assumption (1) that all bonds\nare in fact perfect substitutes up to a scale factor. It follows from as-\nsumption (2) that they must all sell at the same price per dollar's worth\nof return, or what amounts to the same thing must yield the same rate\nof return. This rate of return will be denoted by r and referred to as the\nrate of interest or, equivalently, as the capitalization rate for sure\nstreams. We now can derive the following two basic propositions with\nrespect to the valuation of securities in companies with different capital\nstructures:\nProposition I. Consider any company j and let Xi stand as before for\nthe expected return on the assets owned by the company (that is, its\nexpected profit before deduction of interest). Denote by Di the market\nvalue of the debts of the company; by Sj the market value of its com-\nmon shares; and by Vj=Sj+Dj\nthe market value of all its securities or,\nas we shall say, the market value of the firm. Then, our Proposition I\nasserts that we must have in equilibrium:\n(3)\nVi\n(Sj + Dj) =\nXjl/pk,\nfor any firm j in class k.\nThat is, the market value of any firm is indepezdentt of its capital structure\nand is given by capitalizinzg its expected return at the rate Pk appropriate to\nits class.\nThis proposition can be stated in an equivalent way in terms of the\nfirm's \"average cost of capital,\" Xj/Vj, which is the ratio of its expected\nreturn to the market value of all its securities. Our proposition then is:\nxj\nXj\n(4)\n-\n= Pk, for any firm j, in class k.\n(Sj + Di)\nVa\nThat is, thec average cost of capital, to any firm 'IS comipletely independent of\nMODIGLIANI AND MILLER: THEORY OF INVESTMENT\n269\nits capital structure and is equal to the capitalization rate of a pure equity\nstream of its class.\nTo establish Proposition I we will show that as long as the relations\n(3) or (4) do not hold between any pair of firms in a class, arbitrage will\ntake place and restore the stated equalities. We use the term arbitrage\nadvisedly. For if Proposition I did not hold, an investor could buy and\nsell stocks and bonds in such a way as to exchange one income stream\nfor another stream, identical in all relevant respects but selling at a\nlower price. The exchange would therefore be advantageous to the inves-\ntor quite independently of his attitudes toward risk.1' As investors\nexploit these arbitrage opportunities, the value of the overpriced shares\nwill fall and that of the underpriced shares will rise, thereby tending to\neliminate the discrepancy between the market values of the firms.\nBy way of proof, consider two firms in the same class and assume for\nsimplicity only, that the expected return, X, is the same for both firms.\nLet company 1 be financed entirely with common stock while company\n2 has some debt in its capital structure. Suppose first the value of the\nlevered firm, V2, to be larger than that of the unlevered one, Vi. Con-\nsider an investor holding S2 dollars' worth of the shares of company 2,\nrepresenting a fraction a of the total outstanding stock, S2. The return\nfrom this portfolio, denoted by Y2, will be a fraction ac of the income\navailable for the stockholders of company 2, which is equal to the total\nreturn X2 less the interest charge, rD2. Since under our assumption of\nhomogeneity, the anticipated total return of company 2, X2, is, under\nall circumstances, the same as the anticipated total return to company\n1, XI, we can hereafter replace X2 and Xi by a common symbol X.\nHence, the return from the initial portfolio can be written as:\n(5)\nY2-\na(X -\nrD2).\nNow suppose the investor sold his aS2 worth of company 2 shares and\nacquired instead an amount Sl= a(S2+D2) of the shares of company 1.\nHe could do so by utilizing the amount aS2 realized from the sale of his\ninitial holding and borrowing an additional amount aD2 on his own\ncredit, pledging his new holdings in company 1 as a collateral. He would\nthus secure for himself a fraction sl/S = a(S2+?D2)/S, of the shares and\nearnings of company 1. Making proper allowance for the interest pay-\nments on his personal debt aD2, the return from the new portfolio, Y1, is\ngiven by:\n11 In the language of the theory of choice, the exchanges are movements from inefficient\npoints in the interior to efficient points on the boundary of the investor's opportunity set; and\nnot movements between efficient points along the boundary. Hence for this part of the analysis\nnothing is involved in the way of specific assumptions about investor attitudes or behavior\nother than that investors behave consistently and prefer more income to less income, ceteris\nparibus.\n270\nTHE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n(6)\n-\ncx~(S2\n+ D2)\nV2\n(6)\nY, = t(S2\nX - raD2 = a -\nX -\nraD2.\nSi\nV1\nComparing (5) with (6) we see that as long as V2> V1 we must have\nY1 > Y2, so that it pays owners of company 2's shares to sell their hold-\nings, thereby depressing S2 and hence V2; and to acquire shares of com-\npany 1, thereby raising Si and thus V1. We conclude therefore that\nlevered companies cannot command a premium over unlevered com-\npanies because investors have the opportunity of putting the equivalent\nleverage into their portfolio directly by borrowing on personal account.\nConsider now the other possibility, namely that the market value of\nthe levered company V2 is less than V1. Suppose an investor holds ini-\ntially an amount s1 of shares of company 1, representing a fraction cx of\nthe total outstanding stock, Si. His return from this holding is-\nSi\nY\n-S\nX = agx.\nSi\nSuppose he were to exchange this initial holding for another portfolio,\nalso worth s1, but consisting of S2 dollars of stock of company 2 and of\nd dollars of bonds, where s2 and d are given by:\nS2\nD2\n(7)\nS2=-\n1,\nd =-s.\nV2\nV2\nIn other words the new portfolio is to consist of stock of company 2 and\nof bonds in the proportions S2/V2 and D2/V2, respectively. The return\nfrom the stock in the new portfolio will be a fraction S2/S2 of the total\nreturn to stockholders of company 2, which is (X- rD2), and the return\nfrom the bonds will be rd. Making use of (7), the total return from the\nportfolio, Y2, can be expressed as follows:\nS2\nD2\ns1\nS\nY2=\n-\n(X -\nrD2) + rd = -\n(X - rD2)\n+ r V-S\n=-\nX =\n-\nX\nS2\nV2\nV2\nV2\nV2\n(since si = aSi). Comparing Y2 with Yi we see that, if V2 <SI\nV1, then\nY2 will exceed Y1. Hence it pays the holders of company l's shares to\nsell these holdings and replace them with a mixed portfolio containing\nan appropriate fraction of the shares of company 2.\nThe acquisition of a mixed portfolio of stock of a levered company j\nand of bonds in the proportion Sj/Vj and D1/Vj respectively, may be\nregarded as an operation which \"undoes\" the leverage, giving access to\nan appropriate fraction of the unlevered return Xj. It is this possibility\nof undoing leverage which prevents the value of levered firms from be-\ning consistently less than those of unlevered firms, or more generally\nprevents the average cost of capital\njl/Vj from being systematically\nhigher for levered than for nonlevered companies in the same class.\nMODIGLIANI AND MILLER: THEORY OF INVESTMENT\n271\nSince we have already shown that arbitrage will also prevent V2 from\nbeing larger than VI, we can conclude that in equilibrium we must have\nV2= VI, as stated in Proposition I.\nProposition II. From Proposition I we can derive the following propo-\nsition concerning the rate of return on common stock in companies\nwhose capital structure includes some debt: the expected rate of return\nor yield, i, on the stock of any company j belonging to the kth class is a\nlinear function of leverage as follows:\n(8)\n= pk + (Pk - r) DJ/Sj.\nThat is, the expected yield of a share of stock is equal to the appropriate\ncapitalization rate pk for a pure equity stream in the class, plus a premium\nrelated to financial risk equal to the debt-to-equity ratio times the spread\nbetween\npk and r. Or equivalently, the market price of any share of stock\nis given by capitalizing its expected return at the continuously variable\nrate ij of (8).12\nA number of writers have stated close equivalents of our Proposition\nI although by appealing to intuition rather than by attempting a proof\nand only to insist immediately that the results were not applicable to the\nactual capital markets.'3 Proposition II, however, so far as we have been\nable to discover is new.14 To establish it we first note that, by definition,\nthe expected rate of return, i, is given by:\nXi2-\nrD.\n(9)ij\n-\nSi\nFrom Proposition I, equation (3), we know that:\nXi = pk(Sj + Dj).\nSubstituting in (9) and simplifying, we obtain equation (8).\n12 To illustrate, suppose X= 1000, D=4000, r= 5 per cent and pk= 10 per cent. These values\nimply that V= 10,000 and S= 6000 by virtue of Proposition I. The expected yield or rate of\nreturn per share is then:\n1000 - 200\n4000\n6000\n6000\n3\n's See, for example, J. B. Williams [21, esp. pp. 72-73]; David Durand [3]; and W. A.\nMorton [15]. None of these writers describe in any detail the mechanism which is supposed to\nkeep the average cost of capital constant under changes in capital structure. They seem, how-\never, to be visualizing the equilibrating mechanism in terms of switches by investors between\nstocks and bonds as the yields of each get out of line with their \"riskiness.\" This is an argu-\nment quite different from the pure arbitrage mechanism underlying our proof, and the differ-\nence is crucial. Regarding Proposition I as resting on investors' attitudes toward risk leads\ninevitably to a misunderstanding of many factors influencing relative yields such as, for ex-\nample, limitations on the portfolio composition of financial institutions. See below, esp.\nSection I.D.\n14 Morton does make reference to a linear yield function but only\" ..\nfor the sake of sim-\nplicity and because the particular function used makes no essential difference in my conclu-\nsions\" [15, p. 443, note 21.\n272\nTHE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\nC. Some Qualifications and Extensions of the Basic Propositions\nThe methods and results developed so far can be extended in a num-\nber of useful directions, of which we shall consider here only three: (1)\nallowing for a corporate profits tax under which interest payments are\ndeductible; (2) recognizing the existence of a multiplicity of bonds and\ninterest rates; and (3) acknowledging the presence of market imperfec-\ntions which might interfere with the process of arbitrage. The first two\nwill be examined briefly in this section with some further attention\ngiven to the tax problem in Section II.

In-\nstead, it can be shown (by the same type of proof used for the original\nversion of Proposition I) that the market values of firms in each class\nmust be proportional in equilibrium to their expected return net of\ntaxes (that is, to the sum of the interest paid and expected net stock-\nholder income). This means we must replace each Xi in the original ver-\nsions of Propositions I and II with a new variable Xj7 representing the\ntotal income net of taxes generated by the firm:\n(10)\nXJr--(Xi\n- rDi)(1 - T) + rDi\n7jT + rDj,\nwhere fr-t represents the expected net income accruing to the common\nstockholders and r stands for the average rate of corporate income tax.'5\nAfter making these substitutions, the propositions, when adjusted for\ntaxes, continue to have the same form as their originals. That is, Propo-\nsition I becomes:\n27\n(11)\n_=\nPk, for any firm in class k,\nand Proposition II becomes\n(12)\nrP + (Pkr -\nr) Dl,/S\nSi\nwhere Pkl is the capitalization rate for income net of taxes in class k.\nAlthough the form of the propositions is unaffected, certain interpre-\ntations must be changed. In particular, the after-tax capitalization rate\n15 For simplicity, we shall ignore throughout the tiny element of progression in our present\ncorporate tax and treat r as a constant independent of (Xi-rD,).\nMODIGLIANI AND MILLER: THEORY OF INVESTMENT\n273\nPkT can no longer be identified with the \"average cost of capital\" which\niS Pk = XjVTIj. The difference between Pk and the \"true\" average cost of\ncapital, as we shall see, is a matter of some relevance in connection with\ninvestment planning within the firm (Section II). For the description of\nmarket behavior, however, which is our immediate concern here, the dis-\ntinction is not essential. To simplify presentation, therefore, and to pre-\nserve continuity with the terminology in the standard literature we\nshall continue in this section tQ refer to Pk as the average cost of capital,\nthough strictly speaking this identification is correct only in the absence\nof taxes.\nEffects of a Plurality of Bonds and Interest Rates. In existing capital\nmarkets we find not one, but a whole family of interest rates varying\nwith maturity, with the technical provisions of the loan and, what is\nmost relevant for present purposes, with the financial condition of the\nborrower.16 Economic theory and market experience both suggest that\nthe yields demanded by lenders tend to increase with the debt-equity\nratio of the borrowing firm (or individual). If so, and if we can assume\nas a first approximation that this yield curve, r = r (D/S), whatever its\nprecise form, is the same for all borrowers, then we can readily extend\nour propositions to the case of a rising supply curve for borrowed\nfunds.'7\nProposition I is actually unaffected in form and interpretation by the\nfact that the rate of interest may rise with leverage; while the average\ncost of borrowed funds will tend to increase as debt rises, the average cost\nof funds from all sources will still be independent of leverage (apart\nfrom the tax effect). This conclusion follows directly from the ability of\nthose who engage in arbitrage to undo the leverage in any financial\nstructure by acquiring an appropriately mixed portfolio of bonds and\nstocks. Because of this ability, the ratio of earnings (before interest.\ncharges) to market value--i.e.,\nthe average cost of capital from all\n16 We shall not consider here the extension of the analysis to encompass the time structure of\ninterest rates. Although some of the problems posed by the time structure can be handled with-\nin our comparative statics framework, an adequate discussion would require a separate paper.\n17 We can also develop a theory of bond valuation along lines essentially parallel to those fol-\nlowved for the case of shares. We conjecture that the curve of bond yields as a function of lever-\nage will turn out to be a nonlinear one in contrast to the linear function of leverage developed\nfor common shares. However, we would also expect that the rate of increase in the yield on\nnew issues would not be substantial in practice. This relatively slow rise would reflect the fact\nthat interest rate increases by themselves can never be completely satisfactory to creditors as\ncompensation for their increased risk. Such increases may simply serve to raise r so high rela-\ntive to p that they become self-defeating by giving rise to a situation in which even norrmal\nfluctuations in earnings may force the company into bankruptcy. The difficulty of borrowing\nmore, therefore, tends to show up in the usual case not so much in higher rates as in the form\nof increasingly stringent restrictions imposed on the company's management and finances by\nthe creditors; and ultimately in a comnplete inability to obtain new borrowed funds, at least\nfrom the instituitional investors who normally set the standar(ds in the market for bonds.\n274\nTHE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\nsources-must be the same for all firms in a given class.\"8 In other words,\nthe increased cost of borrowed funds as leverage increases will tend to\nbe offset by a corresponding reduction in the yield of common stock.\nThis seemingly paradoxical result will be examined more closely below\nin connection with Proposition II.\nA significant modification of Proposition I would be required only if\nthe yield curve r=r(D/S)\nwere different for different borrowers, as\nmight happen if creditors had marked preferences for the securities of a\nparticular class of debtors. If, for example, corporations as a class were\nable to borrow at lower rates than individuals having equivalent per-\nsonal leverage, then the average cost of capital to corporations might\nfall slightly, as leverage increased over some range, in reflection of this\ndifferential. In evaluating this possibility, however, remember that the\nrelevant interest rate for our arbitrage operators is the rate on brokers'\nloans and, historically, that rate has not been noticeably higher than\nrepresentative corporate rates.19 The operations of holding companies\nand investment trusts which can borrow on terms comparable to operat-\ning companies represent still another force which could be expected to\nwipe out any marked or prolonged advantages from holding levered\nstocks.20\nAlthough Proposition I remains unaffected as long as the yield curve\nis the same for all borrowers, the relation between common stock yields\nand leverage will no longer be the strictly linear one given by the original\nProposition II. If r increases with leverage, the yield i will still tend to\n18 One normally minor qualification might be noted. Once we relax the assumption that all\nbonds have certain yields, our arbitrage operator faces the danger of something comparable to\n\"gambler's ruin.\" That is, there is always the possibility that an otherwise sound concern-\none whose long-run expected income is greater than its interest liability-might\nbe forced into\nliquidation as a result of a run of temporary losses. Since reorganization generally involves\ncosts, and because the operation of the firm may be hampered during the period of reorganiza-\ntion with lasting unfavorable effects on earnings prospects, we might perhaps expect heavily\nlevered companies to sell at a slight discount relative to less heavily indebted companies of the\nsame class.\n19 Under normal conditions, moreover, a substantial part of the arbitrage process could be\nexpected to take the form, not of having the arbitrage operators go into debt on personal\naccount to put the required leverage into their portfolios, but simply of having them reduce\nthe amount of corporate bonds they already hold when they acquire underpriced unlevered\nstock. Margin requirements are also somewhat less of an obstacle to maintaining any desired\ndegree of leverage in a portfolio than might be thought at first glance. Leverage could be\nlargely restored in the face of higher margin requirements by switching to stocks having more\nleverage at the corporate level.\n20 An extreme form of inequality between borrowing and lending rates occurs, of course, in\nthe case of preferred stocks, which can not be directly issued by individuals on personal\naccount. Here again, however, we would expect that the operations of investment corporations\nplus the ability of arbitrage operators to sell off their holdings of preferred stocks would act to\nprevent the emergence of any substantial premiums (for this reason) on capital structures con-\ntaining preferred stocks. Nor are preferred stocks so far removed from bonds as to make it\nimpossible for arbitrage operators to approximate closely the risk and leverage of a corporate\npreferred stock by incurriing a somewhat smaller debt on personal account.\nMODIGLIANI AND MILLER: THEORY OF INVESTMENT\n275\nrise as D/S increases, but at a decreasing rather than a constant rate.\nBeyond some high level of leverage, depending on the exact form of the\ninterest function, the yield may even start to fall.21 The relation between\ni and D/S could conceivably take the form indicated by the curve MD\n-\nY-4.\n0\no\na:\ne\nW\n_\ncr.\nRATlO\nOF D:EST\nTO TOTAL MARiKET VALUE- DjlVj\nFIGURE 1\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.,t\nI>\n-,\ncj\n~ ~\n~\n~\n~\n~~-\nX\ni~\n0\nFIGURE 1\nw~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n0\n0\nI-~~~~~~~\nin Figure 2, although in practice the curvature would be much less pro-\nnounced.

Remember,\nhowever, that the yield curve of Proposition II is a consequence of the\nmore fundamental Proposition I. Should the demand by the risk-lovers\nprove insufficient to keep the market to the peculiar yield-curve MD,\nthis demand would be reinforced by the action of arbitrage operators.\nThe latter would find it profitable to own a pro-rata share of the firm as\na whole by holding its stock and bonds, the lower yield of the shares\nbeing thus offset by the higher return on bonds.\nD. The Relation of Propositions I and II to Current Doctrines\nThe propositions we have developed with respect to the valuation of\nfirms and shares appear to be substantially at variance with current\ndoctrines in the field of finance. The main differences between our view\nand the current view are summarized graphically in Figures 1 and 2.\nOur Proposition I [equation (4)] asserts that the average cost of capital,\n`j,/V, is a constant for all firms j in class k, independently of their fi-\nnancial structure. This implies that, if we were to take a samnple of firms\nin a given class, and if for each firm we were to plot the ratio of expected\nreturni to market value against some measure of leverage or financial\nstructure, the points would tend to fall on a horizontal straight line\nwith intercept PkJ, like the solid line mm' in Figure 1 .22 From Proposition\nI we derived Proposition II [equation (8)] which, taking the simplest\nversion with r constant, asserts that, for all firms in a class, the relation\nbetween the yield on common stock and financial structure, measured\nby DjlSj, will approximate a straight line with slope (pk7-r)\nand inter-\ncept PkT. This relationship is shown as the solid line MM' in Figure 2, to\nwhich reference has been made earlier.23\nBy contrast, the conventional view among finance specialists appears\nto start from the proposition that, other things equal, the earnings-\nprice ratio (or its reciprocal, the times-earnings multiplier) of a firm's\ncommon stock will normally be only slightly affected by \"moderate\"\namounts of debt in the firm's capital structure.24 Translated into our no\n-2 In Figure 1 the measure of leverage used is Di/lVy (the ratio of debt to market value)\nrather than Dj/Sj (the ratio of debt to equity), the concept used in the analytical develop-\nment. The Dj/Vj measure is introduced at this point because it simplifies comparison and con-\ntrast of our view with the traditional position.\n23 The line MM' in Figure 2 has been drawn with a positive slope on the assumption that\npk>r,\na condition which will normally obtain. Our Proposition II as given in equation (8)\nwould continue to be valid, of course, even in the unlikely event that pk'<r, but the slope of\nMM' would be negative.\n24 See, e.g., Graham and Dodd [6, pp. 464-66]. Without doing violence to this position, we\ncan bring out its implications more sharply by ignoring the qualification and treating the yield\nas a virtual constant over the relevant range. See in this connection the discussion in Durand\n[3, esp. pp. 225-37] of what he calls the \"net income method\" of valuationi.\nMODiGLIANI AND MILLER: 'THEORY OF INVESTMEN'T\n277\ntation, it asserts that for any firm j in the class k,\nX+T - rDj\n#j'\nDj\n(13)\n-\n=\nik*, a constant for-<\nLk\nSi\nS,\nS4\nor, equivalently,\n(14)\nS,= =j\"lik*\nHere ik* represents the capitalization rate or earnings-price ratio on the\ncommon stock and Lk denotes some amount of leverage regarded as the\nmaximum \"reasonable\" amount for firms of the class k. This assumed\nrelationship between yield and leverage is the horizontal solid line ML'\nof Figure 2. Beyond L', the yield will presumably rise sharply as the\nmarket discounts \"excessive\" trading on the equity. This possibility of a\nrising range for high leverages is indicated by the broken-line segment\nL'G in the figure.25\nIf the value of shares were really given by (14) then the over-all mar-\nket value of the firm must be:\nxir -\nrDj\nX*T\n(ik*\n-\nr) D,\n(16)\nVj1S? + Dj\nik*\n+ Dj-i*\n-+\n.i*\nThat is, for any given level of expected total returns after taxes (Y7j)\nand assuming, as seems natural, that ik*> r, the value of the firm must\ntend to rise with debt ;26 whereas our Proposition I asserts that the value\nof the firm is completely independent of the capital structure. Another\nway of contrasting our position with the traditional one is in terms of the\ncost of capital. Solving (16) for Y;/ Vj yields:\n(17)\nXil\nVj = ik* -\n(j1* - r) D,/17V.\nAccording to this equation, the average cost of capital is not indepen-\ndent of capital structure as we have argued, but should tend to fall with\nincreasing leverage, at least within the relevant range of moderate debt\nratios, as shown by the line ms in Figure 1. Or to put it in more familiar\nterms, debt-financing should be \"cheaper\" than equity-financing if not\ncarried too far.\nWhen we also allow for the possibility of a rising range of stock yields\nfor large values of leverage, we obtain a U-shaped curve like nst in\n26 To make it easier to see some of the implications of this hypothesis as well as to prepare\nthe ground for later statistical testing, it will be helpful to assume that the notion of a critical\nlimit on leverage beyond which yields rise rapidly, can be epitomized by a quadratic relation of\nthe form:\n(15)\n*,Sii=\ni* + 13(D,/S,) + a(Dj/Sj)2,\na > 0.\n21 For a typical discussion of how a promoter can, supposedly, increase the market value of a\nfirm by recourse to debt issues, see W. J. Eiteman [4, esp. pp. 11-131.\n278\nTHE AMERICAN ECONOMIC\nREVIEW\nFigure 1 .27 That a yield-curve for stocks of the form ML'G in Figure 2\nimplies a U-shaped cost-of-capital curve has, of course, been recognized\nby many writers. A natural further step has been to suggest that the\ncapital structure corresponding to the trough of the U is an \"optimal\ncapital structure\" towards which management ought to strive in the\nbest interests of the stockholders.28 According to our model, by contrast,\nno such optimal structure exists-all structures being equivalent from\nthe point of view of the cost of capital.\nAlthough the falling, or at least U-shaped, cost-of-capital function is\nin one form or another the dominant view in the literature, the ultimate\nrationale of that view is by no means clear. The crucial element in the\nposition-that the expected earnings-price ratio of the stock is largely\nunaffected by leverage up to some conventional limit-is rarely even\nregarded as something which requires explanation. It is usually simply\ntaken for granted or it is merely asserted that this is the way the market\nbehaves.29 To the extent that the constant earnings-price ratio has a\nrationale at all we suspect that it reflects in most cases the feeling that\nmoderate amounts of debt in \"sound\" corporations do not really add\nvery much to the \"riskiness\" of the stock. Since the extra risk is slight,\nit seems natural to suppose that firms will not have to pay noticeably\nhigher yields in order to induce investors to hold the stock.30\nA more sophisticated line of argument has been advanced by David\nDurand [3, pp. 231-33]. He suggests that because insurance companies\nand certain other important institutional investors are restricted to debt\nsecurities, nonfinancial corporations are able to borrow from them at\ninterest rates which are lower than would be required to compensate\n27 The U-shaped nature of the cost-of-capital curve can be exhibited explicitly if the yield\ncurve for shares as a function of leverage can be approximated by equation (15) of footnote 25.\nFrom that equation, multiplying both sides by Si we obtain: Trj= X,T_-rD;=ik*Si+?fDi+aD2\n/S, or, adding and subtracting ik*Dk from the right-hand side and collecting terms,\n(18)\nxi' = ik*(Si + Di) + (, + r - ik*)Di + aDD2/S1.\nDividing (18) by Vi gives an expression for the cost of capital:\n(19)\nX,T/V, = ik* -\n(ik* - r - O)Di/Vi + aD,2/SiVi\n= ik* - (ik* - r - O)DilVJ\n+ a(Di/Vi)2/(1\n- D3/Vj)\nwhich is clearly U-shaped since a is supposed to be positive.\n28 For a typical statement see S. M. Robbins [16, p. 307]. See also Graham and Dodd [6,\npp. 468-74].\n29 See e.g., Graham and Dodd [6, p. 466].\n80 A typical statement is the following by Guthmann and Dougall [7, p. 245]: \"Theoretically\nit might be argued that the increased hazard from using bonds and preferred stocks would\ncounterbalance this additional income and so prevent the common stock from being more\nattractive than when it had a lower return but fewer prior obligations. In practice, the extra\nearnings from 'trading on the equity' are often regarded by investors as more than sufficient to\nserve as a 'premium for risk' when the proportions of the several securities are judiciously\nmixed.\"\nMODIGLIANI AND MILLER: THEORY OF INVESTMENT\n279\ncreditors in a free market. Thus, while he would presumably agree with\nour conclusions that stockholders could not gain from leverage in an un-\nconstrained market, he concludes that they can gain under present insti-\ntutional arrangements. This gain would arise by virtue of the \"safety\nsuperpremium\" which lenders are willing to pay corporations for the\nprivilege of lending.3'\nThe defective link in both the traditional and the Durand version of\nthe argument lies in the confusion between investors' subjective risk\npreferences and their objective market opportunities. Our Propositions\nI and II, as noted earlier, do not depend for their validity on any as-\nsumption about individual risk preferences. Nor do they involve any as-\nsertion as to what is an adequate compensation to investors for assum-\ning a given degree of risk. They rely merely on the fact that a given\ncommodity cannot consistently sell at more than one price in the mar-\nket; or more precisely that the price of a commodity representing a\n\"bundle\" of two other commodities cannot be consistently different\nfrom the weighted average of the prices of the two components (the\nweights being equal to the proportion of the two commodities in the\nbundle).\nAn analogy may he helpful at this point. The relations between l/pk,\nthe price per dollar of an unlevered stream in class k; 1/r, the price per\ndollar of a sure stream, and 1/ij, the price per dollar of a levered stream\nj, in the kth class, are essentially the same as those between, respective-\nly, the price of whole milk, the price of butter fat, and the price of milk\nwhich has been thinned out by skimming off some of the butter fat. Our\nProposition I states that a firm cannot reduce the cost of capital-i.e.,\nincrease the market value of the stream it generates-by securing part\nof its capital through the sale of bonds, even though debt money ap-\npears to be cheaper. This assertion is equivalent to the proposition that,\nunder perfect markets, a dairy farmer cannot in general earn more for\nthe milk he produces by skimming some of the butter fat and selling\nit separately, even though butter fat per unit weight, sells for more\nthan whole milk. The advantage from skimming the milk rather than\nselling whole milk would be purely illusory; for what would be gained\nfrom selling the high-priced butter fat would be lost in selling the low-\npriced residue of thinned milk. Similarly our Proposition II-that\nthe\nprice per dollar of a levered stream falls as leverage increases-is an ex-\n31 Like Durand, Morton [15] contends \"that the actual market deviates from [Proposition\nI] by giving a changing over-all cost of money at different points of the [leverage] scale\"' (p.\n443, note 2, inserts ours), but the basis for this contention is nowhere clearly stated. Judging\nby the great emphasis given to the lack of mobility of investment funds between stocks and\nbonds and to the psychological and institutional pressures toward debt portfolios (see pp. 444-\n51 and especially his discussion of the optimal capital structure on p. 453) he would seem to be\ntaking a position very similar to that of Durand above.\n280\nTHE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\nact analogue of the statement that the price per gallon of thinned milk\nfalls continuously as more butter fat is skimmed off.32\nIt is clear that this last assertion is true as long as butter fat is worth\nmore per unit weight than whole milk, and it holds even if, for many\nconsumers, taking a little cream out of the milk (adding a little leverage\nto the stock) does not detract noticeably from the taste (does not add\nnoticeably to the risk). Furthermore the argument remains valid even\nin the face of instituional limitations of the type envisaged by Durand.\nFor suppose that a large fraction of the population habitually dines in\nrestaurants which are required by law to serve only cream in lieu of\nmilk (entrust their savings to institutional investors who can only buy\nbonds). To be sure the price of butter fat will then tend to be higher in\nrelation to that of skimmed milk than in the absence such restrictions\n(the rate of interest will tend to be lower), and this will benefit people\nwho eat at home and who like skim milk (who manage their own port-\nfolio and are able and willing to take risk). But it will still be the case\nthat a farmer cannot gain by skimming some of the butter fat and sell-\ning it separately (firm cannot reduce the cost of capital by recourse to\nborrowed funds).3\nOur propositions can be regarded as the extension of the classical\ntheory of markets to the particular case of the capital markets. Those\nwho hold the current view-whether\nthey realize it or not-must\nas-\n32 Let M denote the quantity of whole milk, B/Alf the proportion of butter fat in the whole\nmilk, and let PM, PB and pa denote, respectively, the price per unit weight of whole milk, butter\nfat and thinned milk from which a fraction a of the butter fat has been skimmed off. We then\nhave the fundamental perfect market relation:\n(a)\nPa(M-\naB) + PBoiB = pMM,\nO < a < 1,\nstating that total receipts will be the same amount pMM, independently of the amount aLB of\nbutter fat that may have been sold separately. Since pm corresponds to 1ip, PB to l/r, Pa to\n1/i, M to Z and a-B to rD, (a) is equivalent to Proposition I, S+D=X/p.\nFrom (a) we derive:\n(b)\nPa =\nMi\n- aB -PB\nM-B\nwhich gives the price of thinned milk as an explicit function of the proportion of buitter fat\nskimmed off; the function decreasing as long as PB>pM. From (a) also follows:\n(c)\nI/pa = I/PM + (I/PM - I/PB)\nPa(M B)\nwhich is the exact analogue of Proposition II, as given by (8).\n33 The reader who likes parables will find that the analogy with interrelated commodity\nmarkets can be pushed a good deal farther than we have done in the text. For instance, the\neffect of changes in the market rate of interest on the over-all cost of capital is the same as the\neffect of a change in the price of butter on the price of whole milk. Similarly, just as the rela-\ntion between the prices of skim milk and butter fat influences the kind of cows that will be\nreared, so the relation between i and r influences the kind of ventures that will be undertaken.\nIf people like butter we shall have Guernseys; if they are willing to pay a high price for safety,\nthis will encourage ventures which promise smaller but less uncertain streams per dollar of\nphysical assets.\nMODIGLIANI AND MILLER: THEORY OF INVESTMENT\n281\nsume not merely that there are lags and frictions in the equilibrating\nprocess-a feeling we certainly share,34 claiming for our propositions\nonly that they describe the central tendency around which observations\nwill scatter-but also that there are large and systematic imperfections\nin the market which permanently bias the outcome. This is an assump-\ntion that economists, at any rate, will instinctively eye with some skep-\nticism.\nIn any event, whether such prolonged, systematic departures from\nequilibrium really exist or whether our propositions are better descrip-\ntions of long-run market behavior can be settled only by empirical re-\nsearch. Before going on to the theory of investment it may be helpful,\ntherefore, to look at the evidence.\nE. Some Prelimtinary Evidentce on5 the Basic Propositions\nUnfortunately the evidence which has been assembled so far is amaz-\ningly skimpy. Indeed, we have been able to locate only two recent stud-\nies-and these of rather limited scope-which were designed to throw\nlight on the issue. Pending the results of more comprehensive tests which\nwe hope will soon be available, we shall review briefly such evidence as is\nprovided by the two studies in question: (1) an analysis of the relation\nbetween security yields and financial structure for some 43 large electric\nutilities by F. B. Allen [1], and (2) a parallel (unpublished) study by\nRobert Smith [19], for 42 oil companies designed to test whether Allen's\nrather striking results would be found in an industry with very differ-\nent characteristics.3Y The Allen study is based on average figures for the\nyears 1947 and 1948, while the Smith study relates to the single year\n1953.\nThe Effect of Leverage on the Cost of Capital. According to the received\nview, as shown in equation (17) the average cost of capital, Yr/V,\nshould decline linearly with leverage as measured by the ratio D/V, at\nleast through most of the relevant range.36 According to Proposition I,\nthe average cost of capital within a given class k should tend to have\nthe same value PkT independently of the degree of leverage. A simple test\nSeveral specific examples of the failure of the arbitrage mechanism can be found in Graham\nanid Dodd [6, e.g.. pp. 646-481. The price discrepancy described on pp. 646-47 is particularly\ncurious since it persists even today despite the fact that a whole generation of security analysts\nhas been brought up on this book!\n3 We wish to express our thanks to both writers for making available to us some of their\noriginal worksheets. In addition to these recent studies there is a frequently cited (but appar-\nently seldom read) study by the Federal Communications Commission in 1938 [22] which\npurports to show the existence of an optimal capital structure or range of structures (in the\nsense defined above) for public utilities in the 1930's. By current standards for statistical in-\nvestigations. however, this study cannot be regarded as having any real evidential value for\nthe problem at hand.\n36 We shall simplify our notation in this section by dropping the subscriptj used to denote a\nparticular firm wherever this will not lead to confusion.\n282\nTHE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\nof the merits of the two alternative hypotheses can thus be carried out\nby correlating\n,I/V with D/V. If the traditional view is correct, the\ncorrelation should be significantly negative; if our view represents a bet-\nter approximation to reality, then the correlation should not be signifi-\ncantly different from zero.\nBoth studies provide information about the average value of D-the\nmarket value of bonds and preferred stock-and of V-the market\nvalue of all securities.37 From these data we can readily compute the\nratio D/V and this ratio (expressed as a percentage) is represented by\nthe symbol d in the regression equations below. The measurement of\nthe variable YT/V, however, presents serious difficulties. Strictly speak-\ning, the numerator should measure the expected returns net of taxes,\nbut this is a variable on which no direct information is available. As an\napproximation, we have followed both authors and used (1) the average\nvalue of actual net returns in 1947 and 1948 for Allen's utilities; and (2)\nactual net returns in 1953 for Smith's oil companies. Net return is de-\nfined in both cases as the sum of interest, preferred dividends and stock-\nholders' income net of corporate income taxes. Although this approxima-\ntion to expected returns is undoubtedly very crude, there is no reason to\nbelieve that it will systematically bias the test in so far as the sign of the\nregression coefficient is concerned. The roughness of the approximation,\nhowever, will tend to make for a wide scatter. Also contributing to the\nscatter is the crudeness of the industrial classification, since especially\nwithin the sample of oil companies, the assumption that all the firms be-\nlong to the same class in our sense, is at best only approximately valid.\nDenoting by x our approximation to Yr/V (expressed, like d, as a\npercentage), the results of the tests are as follows:\nElectric Utilities x = 5.3 + .006d\nr = .12\n(? .008)\nOil Companies\nx = 8.5 + .006d\nr = .04.\n(+ .024)\nThe data underlying these equations are also shown in scatter diagram\nform in Figures 3 and 4.\nThe results of these tests are clearly favorable to our hypothesis.\n17 Note that for purposes of this test preferred stocks, since they represent an expected fixed\nobligation, are properly classified with bonds even though the tax status of preferred dividends\nis different from that of interest payments and even though preferred dividends are really\nfixed only as to their maximum in any year. Some difficulty of classification does arise in the\ncase of convertible preferred stocks (and convertible bonds) selling at a substantial premium,\nbut fortunately very few such issues were involved for the companies included in the two\nstudies. Smith included bank loans and certain other short-term obligations (at book values)\nin his data on oil company debts and this treatment is perhaps open to some question. How-\never, the amounts involved were relatively small and check computations showed that their\nelimination would lead to only minor differences in the test results.\nMODIGLIANI AND MILLER: THEORY OF INVESTMENT\n283\n0\n3\n-t----X\ne\n0\n20\n30\n40\na0\n60e\n70\na0\n0\nt\nF;NANCAL STRAOTURE-(MARKET VALUE Or SENIOR StCURIT1ES$\"ARXET 'kLUE OF ALL SECURmSE 100\nFIGURE 3.

COSTr OF CAPITAL IN RELATION TO FINANCIAL STRUCTURE\nFOR 42 OIL COMPANIES, 1953\n284\nTHE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\nBoth correlation coefficients are very close to zero and not statistically\nsignificant. Furthermore, the implications of the traditional view fail to\nbe supported even with respect to the sign of the correlation. The data\nin short provide no evidence of any tendency for the cost of capital to\nfall as the debt ratio increases.38\nIt should also be apparent from the scatter diagrams that there is no\nhint of a curvilinear, U-shaped, relation of the kind which is widely be-\nlieved to hold between the cost of capital and leverage. This graphical\nimpression was confirmed by statistical tests which showed that for\nboth industries the curvature was not significantly different from zero,\nits sign actually being opposite to that hypothesized.39\nNote also that according to our model, the constant terms of the re-\ngression equations are measures of PkT, the capitalization rates for un-\nlevered streams and hence the average cost of capital in the classes in\nquestion. The estimates of 8.5 per cent for the oil companies as against\n5.3 per cent for electric utilities appear to accord well with a priori ex-\npectations, both in absolute value and relative spread.\nThe Effect of Leverage on Common Stock Yields. According to our Prop-\nosition II-see equation 12 and Figure 2-the expected yield on com-\nmon stock, r1/S, in any given class, should tend to increase with lever-\nage as measured by the ratio D/S. The relation should tend to be linear\nand with positive slope through most of the relevant range (as in the\ncurve MM' of Figure 2), though it might tend to flatten out if we move\n38 It may be argued that a test of the kind used is biased against the traditional view. The\nfact that both sides of the regression equation are divided by the variable V which may be\nsubject to random variation might tend to impart a positive bias to the correlation. As a check\non the results presented in the text, we have, therefore, carried out a supplementary test\nbased on equation (16). This equation shows that, if the traditional view is correct, the market\nvalue of a company should, foi given X, increase with debt through most of therelevant range;\naccording to our model the market value should be uncorrelated with D, given Y. Because\nof wide variations in the size of the firms included in our samples, all variables must be divided\nby a suitable scale factor in order to avoid spurious results in carrying out a test of equation\n(16). The factor we have used is the book value of the firm denoted by A. The hypothesis\ntested thus takes the specific form:\nV/A = a + b(XT/A) + c(D/A)\nand the numerator of the ratio XT/A is again approximated by actual net returns. The partial\ncorrelation between V/A and DIA should now be positive according to the traditional view\nand zero according to our model. Although division by A should, if anything, bias the results\nin favor of the traditional hypothesis, the partial correlation turns out to be only .03 for the oil\ncompanies and -.28 for the electric utilities. Neither of these coefficients is significantly differ-\nent from zero and the larger one even has the wrong sign.\n39 The tests consisted of fitting to the data the equation (19) of footnote 27. As shown\nthere, it follows from the U-shaped hypothesis that the coefficient a of the variable (D/V)2\n/(1 -DIV),\ndenoted hereafter by d*, should be significant and positive. The following regres-\nsion equations and partials were obtained:\nElectric Utilities x = 5.0 + .017d - .003d*; rxd* .d =-\n.15\nOil Companies\nx = 8.0 + .05d - .03d*; rzd* .d = -.14.\nMODIGLIANI AND MILLER: THEORY OF INVESTMENT\n285\nfar enough to the right (as in the curve MD'), to the extent that high\nleverage tends to drive up the cost of senior capital. According to the\nconventional view, the yield curve as a function of leverage should be a\nhorizontal straight line (like MVL') through most of the relevant range;\nfar enough to the right, the yield may tend to rise at an increasing rate.\nHere again, a straight-forward correlation-in\nthis case between *#/S\nand D/S-can\nprovide a test of the two positions. If our view is correct,\nthe correlation should be significantly positive; if the traditional view is\ncorrect, the correlation should be negligible.\nSubject to the same qualifications noted above in connection with\nXT, we can approximate fr by actual stockholder net income.40 Letting\nz denote in each case the approximation to fr#/S (expressed as a per-\ncentage) and letting h denote the ratio DIS (also in percentage terms)\nthe following results are obtained:\nElectric Utilities z\n6.6 + .017/i\nr\n.53\n(+ .004)\nOil Companies\nz\n8.9 + .051h\nr = .53.\n(? .012)\nThese results are shown in scatter diagram form in Figures 5 and 6.\nHere again the implications of our analysis seem to be borne out by\nthe data. Both correlation coefficients are positive and highly significant\nwhen account is taken of the substantial sample size. Furthermore, the\nestimates of the coefficients of the equations seem to accord reasonably\nwell with our hypothesis. According to equation (12) the constant term\nshould be the value Of pk' for the given class while the slope should be\n(per-\nr). From the test of Proposition I we have seen that for the oil\ncompanies the mean value of pkT could be estimated at around 8.7.\nSince the average yield of senior capital during the period covered was\nin the order of 3' per cent, we should expect a constant term of about\n8.7 per cent and a slope of just over 5 per cent. These values closely ap-\nproximate the regression estimates of 8.9 per cent and 5.1 per cent re-\nspectively. For the electric utilities, the yield of senior capital was also\non the order of 332 per cent durinn the test years, but since the estimate\nof the mean value of Pkr from the test of Proposition I was 5.6 per cent,\n40 As indicated earlier, Snnm'Ith's\ndata were for the single year 1953. Since the use of a single\nyear's profits as a measure of expected profits might be open to objection we collected profit\ndata for 1952 for the same companies and based the computation of Fr/S on the average of the\ntwo years. The value of 7T/S was obtained from the formula:\n(net earnings in 1952 -s\n+ net earnings in '1953 2\nassets in '522\n* (average market value of common stock in '53).\nThe asset adjustment was introduced as rough allowance for the effects of possible growth in\nthe size of the firm. It might be added that the correlation computed with 7r/S based on net\nprofits in 1953 alone was found to be only slightly smaller, namely .50.\n286\nTHE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\n6\no\n4\nW&\n12_\n0~~~~~~~*\n*12\n04 E\n2-\nuo-\nuw\n20\nw\n.1\n0\n0\n25\nI0\n750\n200\n1250\n160\n350\n200\nH:- LEVERAGE - [(MARKET VALUE OF SENIOR SErURITIESVtMARKET VALUE.

The actual regression estimate\nfor the slope of 1.7 per cent is thus somewhat low, but still within one\nstandard error of its theoretical value. Because of this underestimate of\nthe slope and because of the large mean value of leverage (h = 160 per\ncent) the regression estimate of the constant term, 6.6 per cent, is some-\nwhat high, although not significantly different from the value of 5.6\nper cent obtained in the test of Proposition I.\nWhen we add a square term to the above equations to test for the\npresence and direction of curvature we obtain the following estimates:\nElectric Utilities z = 4.6 + .004h - .007h2\nOil Companies\nz = 8.5 + .072h - .016z2.\nFor both cases the curvature is negative. In fact, for the electric utili-\nties, where the observations cover a wider range of leverage ratios, the\nnegative coefficient of the square term is actually significant at the 5\nper cent level. Negative curvature, as we have seen, runs directly coun-\nter to the traditional hypothesis, whereas it can be readily accounted\nfor by our model in terms of rising cost of borrowed funds.4'\nIn summary, the empirical evidence we have reviewed seems to be\nbroadly consistent with our model and largely inconsistent with tradi-\ntional views. Needless to say much more extensive testing will be re-\nquired before we can firmly conclude that our theory describes market\nbehavior. Caution is indicated especially with regard to our test of\nProposition IT, partly because of possible statistical pitfalls42 and partly\nbecause not all the factors that might have a systematic effect on stock\nyields have been considered. In particular, no attempt was made to test\nthe possible influence of the dividend pay-out ratio whose role has\ntended to receive a great deal of attention in current research and think-\ning. There are two reasons for this omission. First, our main objective\nhas been to assess the prima facie tenability of our model, and in this\nmodel, based as it is on rational behavior by investors, dividends per se\nplay no role. Second, in a world in which the policy of dividend stabiliza-\ntion is widespread, there is no simple way of disentangling the true ef-\nfect of dividend payments on stock prices from their apparent effect,\n4 That the yield of senior capital tended to rise for utilities as leverage increased is clearly\nshown in several of the scatter diagrams presented in the published version of Allen's study.\nThis significant negative curvature between stock yields and leverage for utilities may be part-\nly responsible for the fact, previously noted, that the constant in the linear regression is some-\nwhat higher and the slope somewhat lower than implied by equation (12). Note also in connec-\ntion with the estimate of Pk' that the introduction of the quadratic term reduces the constant\nconsiderably, pushing it in fact below the a priori expectation of 5.6, though the difference is\nagain not statistically significant.\n42 In our test, e.g., the two variables z and h are both ratios with S appearing in the denomi-\nnator, which may tend to impart a positive bias to the correlation (cf. note 38). Attempts were\nmade to develop alternative tests, but although various possibilities were explored, we have\nso far been unable to find satisfactory alternatives.\n288\nTHE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\nthe latter reflecting only the role of dividends as a proxy measure of\nlong-term earning anticipations.43 The difficulties just mentioned are\nfurther compounded by possible interrelations between dividend policy\nand leverage.44\nII. Imtplications of the Analysis for the Theory of Investment\nA. Capital Structure and Investment Policy\nOn the basis of our propositions with respect to cost of capital and\nfinancial structure (and for the moment neglecting taxes), we can derive\nthe following simple rule for optimal investment policy by the firm:\nProposition III. If a firm in class k is acting in the best interest of the\nstockholders at the time of the decision, it will exploit an investment op-\nportunity if and only if the rate of return on the investment, say p*,\nis as large as or larger than pk. That is, the cut-off point for investment\nin the firm will in all cases be Pk and will be completely unaffected by the\ntype of security used to finance the investment. Equivalently, we may say\nthat regardless of the financing used, the marginal cost of capital to a\nfirm is equal to the average cost of capital, which is in turn equal to the\ncapitalization rate for an unlevered stream in the class to which the\nfirm belongs.45\nTo establish this result we will consider the three major financing al-\nternatives open to the firm--bonds,\nretained earnings, and common\nstock issues-and\nshow that in each case an investment is worth under-\ntaking if, and only if, p =pk.46\nConsider first the case of an investment financed by the sale of bonds.\nWe know from Proposition I that the market value of the firm before the\ninvestment was undertaken was:47\n(20)\nV0 = Xo/pk\n43We suggest that failure to appreciate this difficulty is responsible for many fallacious, or\nat least unwarranted, conclusions about the role of dividends.\n44 In the sample of electric utilities, there is a substantial negative correlation between yields\nand pay-out ratios, but also between pay-out ratios and leverage, suggesting that either the\nassociation of yields and leverage or of yields and pay-out ratios may be (at least partly)\nspurious. These difficulties however do not arise in the case of the oil industry sample. A pre-\nliminary analysis indicates that there is here no significant relation between leverage and\npay-out ratios and also no significant correlation (either gross or partial) between yields and\npay-out ratios.\n45 The analysis developed in this paper is essentially a comparative-statics, not a dynamic\nanalysis. This note of caution applies with special force to Proposition III. Such problems as\nthose posed by expected changes in r and in pk over time will not be treated here. Although\nthey are in principle amenable to analysis within the general framework we have laid out, such\nan undertaking is sufficiently complex to deserve separate treatment. Cf. note 17.\n\" The extension of the proof to other types of financing, such as the sale of preferred stock or\nthe issuance of stock rights is straightforward.\n47 Since no confusion is likely to arise, we have again, for simplicity, eliminated the subscripts\nidentifying the firm in the eqtuations to follow. Except for Pk, the subscripts now refer to time\nperiods.\nMODIGLIANI AND MILLER: THEORY OF INVESTMENT\n289\nand that the value of the common stock was:\n(21)\nS0 - V0 -\nDo.\nIf now the firm borrows I dollars to finance an investment yielding p* its\nmarket value will become:\nTo + P*\n_\n*\n(22)\nVI=\n-\n+ p*Ip*\nPk\nPk\nand the value of its common stock will be:\nP*I\n(23)\nS1 = V1 - (Do + 1)\nV1' +\nDo - I\nPk\nor using equation 21,\np*I\n(24)\nKSi\n= So + --- -I.\nPk/\nHence S1iS0 as p*<pk.48\nTo illustrate, suppose the capitalization rate for uncertain streams in\nthe kth class is 10 per cent and the rate of interest is 4 per cent. Then if\na given company had an expected income of 1,000 and if it were financed\nentirely by common stock we know from Proposition I that the market\nvalue of its stock would be 10,000. Assume now that the managers of the\nfirm discover an investment opportunity which will require an outlay of\n100 and which is expected to yield 8 per cent. At first sight this might\nappear to be a profitable opportunity since the expected return is double\nthe interest cost. If, however, the management borrows the necessary\n100 at 4 per cent, the total expected income of the company rises to\n1,008 aind the market value of the firm to 10,080. But the firm now will\nhave 100 of bonds in its capital structure so that, paradoxically, the\nmarket value of the stock must actually be reduced from 10,000 to\n9,980 as a consequence of this apparently profitable investment. Or, to\nput it another way, the gains from being able to tap cheap, borrowed\nfunds are more than offset for the stockholders by the market's discount-\ning of the stock for the added leverage assumed.\nConsider next the case of retained earnings. Suppose that in the course\nof its operations the firm acquired I dollars of cash (without impairing\n48 In the case of bond-financing the rate of interest on bonds does not enter explicitly into\nthe decision (assuming the firm borrows at the market rate of interest). This is true, more-\nover, given the conditions outlined in Section I.C, even though interest rates may be\nan increasing function of debt outstanding. To the extent that the firm borrowed at a rate\nother than the market rate the two I's in equation (24) would no longer be identical and an\nadditional gain or loss, as the case might be, would accrue to the shareholders. It might also\nbe noted in passing that permitting the two I's in (24) to take on different values provides a\nsimple method for introducing underwriting expenses into the analysis.\n290\nTHE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\nthe earning power of its assets). If the cash is distributed as a dividend\nto the stockholders their wealth Wo, after the distribution will be:\nXO\n(25)\nWo = So + I =\n- Do + I\nPk\nwhere Xo represents the expected return from the assets exclusive of the\namount I in question.

Let Po denote\nthe current market price per share of stock and assume, for simplicity,\nthat this price reflects currently expected earnings only, that is, it does\nnot reflect any future increase in earnings as a result of the investment\nunder consideration.50 Then if N is the original number of shares, the\nprice per share is:\n(27)\nPo = SO/N\nand the number of new shares, M, needed to finance an investment of I\ndollars is given by:\n(28)\nM\nPO\nAs a result of the investment the market value of the stock becomes:\nXO + P*I\np*I\np*I\nSi -\n- Do = So +\n-NPo +\n-\npk\nPk\nPk\nand the price per share:\n(29)\np\nS\n1\n[NPo +\n-\nN + M\nN + M\nPC\nc\n49 The conclusion that pk is the cut-off point for investments financed from internal funds\napplies not only to undistributed net profits, but to depreciation allowances (and even to the\nfunds represented by the current sale value of any asset or collection of assets). Since the\nowners can earn Pk by investing funds elsewhere in the class, partial or total liquidating distri-\nbutions should be made whenever the firm cannot achieve a marginal internal rate of return\nequal to pk.\n60 If we assumed that the market price of the stock did reflect the expected higher future\nearnings (as would be the case if our original set of assumptions above were strictly followed)\nthe analysis would differ slightly in detail, but not in essentials. The cut-off point for new in-\nvestment would still be pk, but where p*>pk the gain to the original owners would be larger\nthan if the stock price were based on the pre-investment expectations only.\nMODIGLIANI AND MILLER: THEORY OF INVESTMENT\n291\nSince by equation (28), 1 = MPo, we can add MPO and subtract I from\nthe quantity in bracket, obtaining:\nP1\nN+\nL\n)\nPkc1\nPi-\n[(N7 + M)PO +-I\n(30)\n1\n*Pf\n=Po + N -\nP\nI > Po if7\nand only if, p*>pk.\nThus an investment financed by common stock is advantageous to the\ncurrent stockholders if and only if its yield exceeds the capitalization\nrate Pk-\nOnce again a numerical example may help to illustrate the result and\nmake it clear why the relevant cut-off rate is Pk and not the current yield\non common stock, i. Suppose that Pk iS 10 per cent, r is 4 per cent, that\nthe original expected income of our company is 1,000 and that manage-\nment has the opportunity of investing 100 having an expected yield of\n12 per cent. If the original capital structure is 50 per cent debt and 50\nper cent equity, and 1,000 shares of stock are initially outstanding,\nthen, by Proposition I, the market value of the common stock must be\n5,000 or 5 per share. Furthermore, since the interest bill is .04X5,000\n= 200, the yield on common stock is 800/5,000=16 per cent. It may\nthen appear that financing the additional investment of 100 by issuing\n20 shares to outsiders at 5 per share would dilute the equity of the origi-\nnal owners since the 100 promises to yield 12 per cent whereas the com-\nmon stock is currently yielding 16 per cent. Actually, however, the\nincome of the company would rise to 1,012; the value of the firm to\n10,120; and the value of the common stock to 5,120. Since there are\nnow 1,020 shares, each would be worth 5.02 and the wealth of the origi-\nnal stockholders would thus have been increased. What has happened\nis that the dilution in expected earnings per share (from .80 to .796) has\nbeen more than offset, in its effect upon the market price of the shares,\nby the decrease in leverage.\nOur conclusion is, once again, at variance with conventional views,5'\nso much so as to be easily misinterpreted. Read hastily, Proposition III\nseems to imply that the capital structure of a firm is a matter of indiffer-\nence; and that, consequently, one of the core problems of corporate\nfinance-the problem of the optimal capital structure for a firm-is no\nproblem at all. It may be helpful, therefore, to clear up such possible\nmisundertandings.\n51 In the matter of investment policy under uncertainty there is no single position which\nrepresents \"accepted\" doctrine. For a sample of current formulationis, all very different from\nours, see Joel Dean [2, esp. Ch. 3], M. Gordon and E. Shapiro [51, and Harry Roberts [171.\n292\nTHE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\nB. Proposition III and Financial Planning by Firms\nMisinterpretation of the scope of Proposition III can be avoided by\nremembering that this Proposition tells us only that the type of instru-\nment used to finance an investment is irrelevant to the question of\nwhether or not the investment is worth while. This does not mean that\nthe owners (or the managers) have no grounds whatever for preferring\none financing plan to another; or that there are no other policy or tech-\nnical issues in finance at the level of the firm.\nThat grounds for preferring one type of financial structure to another\nwill still exist within the framework of our model can readily be seen\nfor the case of common-stock financing. In general, except for some-\nthing like a widely publicized oil-strike, we would expect the market to\nplace very heavy weight on current and recent past earnings in forming\nexpectations as to future returns. Hence, if the owners of a firm dis-\ncovered a major investment opportunity which they felt would yield\nmuch more than Pk, they might well prefer not to finance it via common\nstock at the then ruling price, because this price may fail to capitalize\nthe new venture. A better course would be a pre-emptive issue of stock\n(and in this connection it should be remembered that stockholders are\nfree to borrow and buy). Another possibility would be to finance the\nproject initially with debt. Once the project had reflected itself in in-\ncreased actual earnings, the debt could be retired either with an equity\nissue at much better prices or through retained earnings. Still another\npossibility along the same lines might be to combine the two steps by\nmneans of a convertible debenture or preferred stock, perhaps with a\nprogressively declining conversion rate. Even such a double-stage\nfinancing plan may possibly be regarded as yielding too large a share\nto outsiders since the new stockholders are, in effect, being given an\ninterest in any similar opportunities the firm may discover in the future.\nIf there is a reasonable prospect that even larger opportunities may arise\nin the near future and if there is some danger that borrowing now would\npreclude more borrowing later, the owners might find their interests\nbest protected by splitting off the current opportunity into a separate\nsubsidiary with independent financing. Clearly the problems involved\nin making the crucial estimates and in planning the optimal financial\nstrategy are by no means trivial, even though they should have no bear-\ning on the basic decision to invest (as long as p*>pkP).52\nAnother reason why the alternatives in financial plans may not be a\nmatter of indifference arises from the fact that managers are concerned\n62 Nor can w e rule out the possibility that the existing owners, if unable to use a financing\nplan which protects their interest, may actually prefer to pass Up an otherwise profitable ven-\nture rather than give outsiders an \"excessive\" share of the business. It is presumably in situa-\ntions of this kind that we could justifiably speak of a shortage of \"equity capital,\" though this\nkind of market imperfection is likely to be of significance only for small or new firms.\nMODIGLIANI AND MILLER: THEORY OF INVESTMENT\n293\nwith more than simply furthering the interest of the owners. Such other\nobjectives of the management-which need not be necessarily in con-\nflict with those of the owners-are much more likely to be served by\nsome types of financing arrangements than others. In many forms of\nborrowing agreements, for example, creditors are able to stipulate terms\nwhich the current management may regard as infringing on its preroga-\ntives or restricting its freedom to maneuver. The creditors might even\nbe able to insist on having a direct voice in the formation of policy.53 To\nthe extent, therefore, that financial policies have these implications for\nthe management of the firm, something like the utility approach de-\nscribed in the introductory section becomes relevant to financial (as\nopposed to investment) decision-making. It is, however, the utility func-\ntions of the managers per se and not of the owners that are now in-\nvolved.14\nIn summary, many of the specific considerations which bulk so large\nin traditional discussions of corporate finance can readily be superim-\nposed on our simple framework without forcing any drastic (and cer-\ntainly no systematic) alteration of the conclusion which is our principal\nconcern, namely that for investment decisions, the marginal cost of\ncapital is Pk.\nC. TUhe Effect of the Corporate Income T'ax on Investment Decisions\nIn Section I it was shown that when an unintegrated corporate inconme\ntax is introduced, the original version of our Proposition I,\nX/V\n=\nPk = a constant\nmust be rewritten as:\n(X-rD)(l-T)+rD\nX7\n(11)\nPk=\na constant.\nV\nV\nThroughout Section I we found it convenient to refer to XlV\nas the\ncost of capital. The appropriate measure of the cost of capital relevant\nSimilar considerations are involved in the matter of dividend policy. Even though the\nstockholders may be indifferent as to payout policy as long as investment policy is optimal,\nthe management need not be so. Retained earnings involve far fewer threats to control than\nany of the alternative sources of funds and, of course, involve no underwriting expense or risk.\nBut against these advantages management must balance the fact that sharp changes in divi-\ndend rates, which heavy reliance on retained earnings might imply, may give the impression\nthat a firm's finances are being poorly managed, with consequent threats to the control and\nprofessional standing of the management.\n54 In principle, at least, this introduction of management's risk preferences with respect to\nfinancing methods would do much to reconcile the apparent conflict between Proposition Ill\nand such empirical findings as those of Modigliani and Zeman [141 on the close relation between\ninterest rates and the ratio of new debt to new equity issues; or of John Lintner [121 on the\nconsiderable stability in target and actual dividend-payout ratios.\n294\nTHE AMERICAN ECONOMIC\nREVIEW\nto investment decisions, however, is the ratio of the expected return\nbefore taxes to the market value, i.e., X/V. From (11) above we find:\n(31)\n-\n- Tr(D/V)\n-\nPk_\n[\nTrD]\nV\n1 - 7r\nI\n-_\n_\nPk'V\nwhich shows that the cost of capital now depends on the debt ratio,\ndecreasing, as D/V rises, at the constant rate rr/(1 -T).5 Thus, with\na corporate income tax under which interest is a deductible expense,\ngains can accrue to stockholders from having debt in the capital struc-\nture, even when capital marKets are perfect. The gains however are\nsmall, as can be seen from (31), and as will be shown more explicitly\nbelow.\nFrom (31) we can develop the tax-adjusted counterpart of Proposi-\ntion III by interpreting the term DIV in that equation as the proportion\nof debt used in any additional financing of V dollars. For example, in\nthe case where the financing is entirely by new common stock, D=0\nand the required rate of return pkS on a venture so financed becomes:\n(32)\nPkS\nPk\nFor the other extreme of pure debt financing D= V and the required\nrate of return, pkD, becomes:\nPk\nr\nl\nF\nrl\n(33\\\nPk D =\n[\np\n=\nPkT\n-\n_\nr._\n1 - '\nPk7\nJL\nPkC r\nFor investments financed out of retained earnings, the problem of defin-\ning the required rate of return is more difficult since it involves a com-\nparison of the tax consequences to the individual stockholder of receiv-\ning a dividend versus having a capital gain. Depending on the time of\nrealization, a capital gain produced by retained earnings may be taxed\neither at ordinary income tax rates, 50 per cent of these rates, 25 per\n56 Equation (31) is amenable, in principle, to statistical tests similar to those described in\nSection I.E. However we have not made any systematic attempt to carry out such tests so far,\nbecause neither the Allen nor the Smith study provides the required information. Actually,\nSmith's data included a very crude estimate of tax liability, and, using this estimate, we did in\nfact obtain a negative relation between X/V and DIV. However, the correlation (-.28) turned\nout to be significant only at about the 10 per cent level. While this result is not conclusive, it\nshould be remembered that, according to our theory, the slope of the regression equation should\nbe in any event quite smiall. In fact, with a value of r in the order of .5, and values of pkJ and\nr in the order of 8.5 and 3.5 per cent respectively (cf. Section I.E) an increase in DIV from\n0 to 60 per cent (which is, approximately, the range of variation of this variable in the sample)\nshould tend to reduce the average cost of capital only from about 17 to about 15 per cent.\n56 This conclusion does not extend to preferred stocks even though they have been classed\nwith debt issues previously. Since preferred dividends except for a portion of those of public\nutilities are not in general deductible from the corporate tax, the cut-off point for new financing\nvia preferred stock is exactly the same as that for common stock.\nMODIGLIANI AND MILLER: THEORY OF INVESTMENT\n295\ncent, or zero, if held till death. The rate on any dividends received in the\nevent of a distribution will also be a variable depending on the amount\nof other income received by the stockholder, and with the added com-\nplications introduced by the current dividend-credit provisions. If we\nassume that the managers proceed on the basis of reasonable estimates\nas to the average values of the relevant tax rates for the owners, then\nthe required return for retained earnings PkR can be shown to be:\n1\n1i- Td\nl-Td\n(34)\nPkR _ Pkt\nPk\nwhere Td is the assumed rate of personal income tax on dividends and\nIr is the assumed rate of tax on capital gains.\nA numerical illustration may perhaps be helpful in clarifying the rela-\ntionship betwveen these required rates of return. If we take the following\nround numbers as representative\norder-of-magnitude values under\npresent conditions: an after-tax capitalization rate Pkr of 10 per cent, a\nrate of interest on bonds of 4 per cent, a corporate tax rate of 50 per cent,\na marginal personal income tax rate on dividends of 40 per cent (cor-\nresponding to an income of about $25,000 on a joint return), and a capi-\ntal gains rate of 20 per cent (one-half the marginal rate on dividends),\nthen the required rates of return would be: (1) 20 per cent for invest-\nments financed entirely by issuance of new common shares; (2) 16 per\ncent for investments financed entirely by new debt; and (3) 15 per cent\nfor investments financed wholly from internal funds.\nThese results would seem to have considerable significance for current\ndiscussions of the effect of the corporate income tax on financial policy\nand on investment. Although we cannot explore the implications of the\nresults in any detail here, we should at least like to call attention to the\nremarkably small difference between the \"cost\" of equity funds and\ndebt funds. With the numerical values assumed, equity money turned\nout to be only 25 per cent more expensive than debt money, rather than\nsomething on the order of 5 times as expensive as is commonly supposed\nto be the case.57 The reason for the wide difference is that the traditional\n57 See e.g.. D. T. Smith [18]. It should also be pointed out that our tax system acts in other\nways to reduce the gains from debt financing. Heavy reliance on debt in the capital structure,\nfor example, commits a company to paying out a substantial proportion of its income in the\nform of interest payments taxable to the owners under the personal income tax. A debt-free\ncompany, bv contrast, can reinvest in the business all of its (smaller) net income and to this\nextent subject the owners only to the low capital gains rate (or possibly no tax at all by virtue\nof the loophole at death). Thus, we should expect a high degree of leverage to be of value to\nthe owners, even in the case of closely held corporations, primarily in cases where their firm\nwas not expected to have much need for additional funds to expand assets and earnings in the\nfuture. To the extent that opportunities for growth were available, as they presumably would\nbe for most successful corporations, the interest of the stockholders would tend to be better\nserved by a structure which permitted maximum use of retained earnings.\n296\nTHE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW\nview starts from the position that debt funds are several times cheaper\nthan equity funds even in the absence of taxes, with taxes serving sim-\nply to magnify the cost ratio in proportion to the corporate rate. By\ncontrast, in our model in which the repercussions of debt financing on\nthe value of shares are taken into account, the only difference in cost is\nthat due to the tax effect, and its magnitude is simply the tax on the\n\"grossed up\" interest payment. Not only is this magnitude likely to be\nsmall but our analysis yields the further paradoxical implicationi that\nthe stockholders' gain from, and hence incentive to use, debt financing is\nactually smaller the lower the rate of interest. In the extreme case\nwhere the firm could borrow for practically nothing, the advantage of\ndebt financing would also be practically nothing.\nIII. Conclusion\nWith the development of Proposition III the main objectives we out-\nlined in our introductory discussion have been reached. We have in our\nPropositions I and II at least the foundations of a theory of the valua-\ntion of firms and shares in a world of uncertainty. We have shown,\nmoreover, how this theory can lead to an operational definition of the\ncost of capital and how that concept can be used in turn as a basis for\nrational investment decision-making within the firm. Needless to say,\nhowever, much remains to be done before the cost of capital can be\nput away on the shelf among the solved problems. Our approach has\nbeen that of static, partial equilibrium analysis. It has assumed among\nother things a state of atomistic competition in the capital markets and\nan ease of access to those markets which only a relatively small (though\nimportant) group of firms even come close to possessing. These and\nother drastic simplifications have been necessary in order to come to\ngrips with the problem at all. Having served their purpose they can now\nbe relaxed in the direction of greater realism and relevance, a task in\nwhich we hope others interested in this area will wish to share.\nREFERENCES\n1. F.

Jensen\nHarvard Business School\nand\nWilliam H. Meckling*\nUniversity of Rochester\n1.  Introduction\n1.1. Motivation of the Paper\nIn this paper we draw on recent progress in the theory of (1) property rights, (2) agency,\nand (3) finance to develop a theory of ownership structure1 for the firm.  In addition to tying\ntogether elements of the theory of each of these three areas, our analysis casts new light on and\nhas implications for a variety of issues in the professional and popular literature including the\ndefinition of the firm, the “separation of ownership and control,” the “social responsibility” of\nbusiness, the definition of a “corporate objective function,” the determination of an optimal capital\nstructure, the specification of the content of credit agreements, the theory of organizations, and the\nsupply side of the completeness of markets problems.\n1 We do not use the term ‘capital structure’ because that term usually denotes the relative quantities of\nbonds, equity, warrants, trade credit, etc., which represent the liabilities of a firm.  Our theory implies there is\nanother important dimension to this problem—namely the relative amount of ownership claims held by\ninsiders (management) and outsiders (investors with no direct role in the management of the firm).\nJensen and Meckling\n2\n1976\nOur theory helps explain:\n1. why an entrepreneur or manager in a firm which has a mixed financial structure\n(containing both debt and outside equity claims) will choose a set of activities for the\nfirm such that the total value of the firm is less than it would be if he were the sole\nowner and why this result is independent of whether the firm operates in monopolistic\nor competitive product or factor markets;\n2. why his failure to maximize the value of the firm is perfectly consistent with\nefficiency;\n3. why the sale of common stock is a viable source of capital even though managers do\nnot literally maximize the value of the firm;\n4. why debt was relied upon as a source of capital before debt financing offered any tax\nadvantage relative to equity;\n5. why preferred stock would be issued;\n6. why accounting reports would be provided voluntarily to creditors and stockholders,\nand why independent auditors would be engaged by management to testify to the\naccuracy and correctness of such reports;\n7. why lenders often place restrictions on the activities of firms to whom they lend, and\nwhy firms would themselves be led to suggest the imposition of such restrictions;\n8. why some industries are characterized by owner-operated firms whose sole outside\nsource of capital is borrowing;\n9. why highly regulated industries such as public utilities or banks will have higher debt\nequity ratios for equivalent levels of risk than the average nonregulated firm;\n10. why security analysis can be socially productive even if it does not increase portfolio\nreturns to investors.\nJensen and Meckling\n3\n1976\n1.2 Theory of the Firm:  An Empty Box?\nWhile the literature of economics is replete with references to the “theory of the firm,”\nthe material generally subsumed under that heading is not actually a theory of the firm but rather a\ntheory of markets in which firms are important actors.  The firm is a “black box” operated so as\nto meet the relevant marginal conditions with respect to inputs and outputs, thereby maximizing\nprofits, or more accurately, present value.  Except for a few recent and tentative steps, however,\nwe have no theory which explains how the conflicting objectives of the individual participants are\nbrought into equilibrium so as to yield this result.  The limitations of this black box view of the firm\nhave been cited by Adam Smith and Alfred Marshall, among others.  More recently, popular and\nprofessional debates over the “social responsibility” of corporations, the separation of ownership\nand control, and the rash of reviews of the literature on the “theory of the firm” have evidenced\ncontinuing concern with these issues.2\nA number of major attempts have been made during recent years to construct a theory of\nthe firm by substituting other models for profit or value maximization, with each attempt motivated\nby a conviction that the latter is inadequate to explain managerial behavior in large corporations.3\nSome of these reformulation attempts have rejected the fundamental  principle of maximizing\n2 Reviews of this literature are given by Peterson (1965), Alchian (1965, 1968), Machlup (1967), Shubik (1970),\nCyert and Hedrick (1972), Branch (1973), Preston (1975).\n3 See Williamson (1964, 1970, 1975), Marris (1964), Baumol (1959), Penrose (1958), and Cyert and March\n(1963).  Thorough reviews of these and other contributions are given by Machlup (1967) and Alchian (1965).\nSimon (1955) developed a model of human choice incorporating information (search) and computational\ncosts which also has important implications for the behavior of managers.  Unfortunately, Simon’s work has\noften been misinterpreted as a denial of maximizing behavior, and misused, especially in the marketing and\nbehavioral science literature.  His later use of the term “satisficing” (Simon, 1959) has undoubtedly\ncontributed to this confusion because it suggests rejection of maximizing behavior rather than maximization\nsubject to costs of information and of decision making.\nJensen and Meckling\n4\n1976\nbehavior as well as rejecting the more specific profit-maximizing model.  We retain the notion of\nmaximizing behavior on the part of all individuals in the analysis that follows.4\n1.3 Property Rights\nAn independent stream of research with important implications for the theory of the firm\nhas been stimulated by the pioneering work of Coase, and extended by Alchian, Demsetz, and\nothers.5  A comprehensive survey of this literature is given by Furubotn and Pejovich (1972).\nWhile the focus of this research has been “property rights”,6 the subject matter encompassed is\nfar broader than that term suggests.  What is important for the problems addressed here is that\nspecification of individual rights determines how costs and rewards will be allocated among the\nparticipants in any organization.  Since the specification of rights is generally affected through\ncontracting (implicit as well as explicit), individual behavior in organizations, including the behavior\nof managers, will depend upon the nature of these contracts.  We focus in this paper on the\nbehavioral implications of the property rights specified in the contracts between the owners and\nmanagers of the firm.\n1.4 Agency Costs\nMany problems associated with the inadequacy of the current theory of the firm can also\nbe viewed as special cases of the theory of agency relationships in which there is a growing\n4 See Meckling (1976) for a discussion of the fundamental importance of the assumption of resourceful,\nevaluative, maximizing behavior on the part of individuals in the development of theory.  Klein (1976) takes\nan approach similar to the one we embark on in this paper in his review of the theory of the firm and the law.\n5 See Coase (1937, 1959, 1960), Alchian (1965, 1968), Alchian and Kessel (1962), Demsetz (1967), Alchian and\nDemsetz (1972), Monson and Downs (1965), Silver and Auster (1969), and McManus (1975).\n6 Property rights are of course human rights, i.e., rights which are possessed by human beings.  The\nintroduction of the wholly false distinction between property rights and human rights in many policy\ndiscussions is surely one of the all time great semantic flimflams.\nJensen and Meckling\n5\n1976\nliterature.7  This literature has developed independently of the property rights literature even\nthough the problems with which it is concerned are similar; the approaches are in fact highly\ncomplementary to each other.\nWe define an agency relationship as a contract under which one or more persons (the\nprincipal(s)) engage another person (the agent) to perform some service on their behalf which\ninvolves delegating some decision making authority to the agent.  If both parties to the relationship\nare utility maximizers, there is good reason to believe that the agent will not always act in the best\ninterests of the principal.  The principal can limit divergences from his interest by establishing\nappropriate incentives for the agent and by incurring monitoring costs designed to limit the\naberrant activities of the agent.  In addition in some situations it will pay the agent to expend\nresources (bonding costs) to guarantee that he will not take certain actions which would harm the\nprincipal or to ensure that the principal will be compensated if he does take such actions.\nHowever, it is generally impossible for the principal or the agent at zero cost to ensure that the\nagent will make optimal decisions from the principal’s viewpoint.  In most agency relationships the\nprincipal and the agent will incur positive monitoring and bonding costs (non-pecuniary as well as\npecuniary), and in addition there will be some divergence between the agent’s decisions8 and\nthose decisions which would maximize the welfare of the principal.  The dollar equivalent of the\nreduction in welfare experienced by the principal as a result of this divergence is also a cost of the\nagency relationship, and we refer to this latter cost as the “residual loss.”  We define agency\ncosts as the sum of:\n7  Cf. Berhold (1971), Ross (1973, 1974a), Wilson (1968, 1969), and Heckerman (1975).\n8  Given the optimal monitoring and bonding activities by the principal and agent.\nJensen and Meckling\n6\n1976\n1. the monitoring expenditures by the principal,9\n2. the bonding expenditures by the agent,\n3. the residual loss.\nNote also that agency costs arise in any situation involving cooperative effort (such as the co-\nauthoring of this paper) by two or more people even though there is no clear-cut principal-agent\nrelationship.  Viewed in this light it is clear that our definition of agency costs and their importance\nto the theory of the firm bears a close relationship to the problem of shirking and monitoring of\nteam production which Alchian and Demsetz (1972) raise in their paper on the theory of the firm.\nSince the relationship between the stockholders and the managers of a corporation fits the\ndefinition of a pure agency relationship, it should come as no surprise to discover that the issues\nassociated with the “separation of ownership and control” in the modern diffuse ownership\ncorporation are intimately associated with the general problem of agency.  We show below that an\nexplanation of why and how the agency costs generated by the corporate form are born leads to a\ntheory of the ownership (or capital) structure of the firm.\nBefore moving on, however, it is worthwhile to point out the generality of the agency\nproblem.  The problem of inducing an “agent” to behave as if he were maximizing the\n“principal’s” welfare is quite general.  It exists in all organizations and in all cooperative efforts—\nat every level of management in firms,10 in universities, in mutual companies, in cooperatives, in\n9 As it is used in this paper the term monitoring includes more than just measuring or observing the behavior\nof the agent.  It includes efforts on the part of the principal to ‘control’ the behavior of the agent through\nbudget restrictions, compensation policies, operating rules, etc.\n10 As we show below the existence of positive monitoring and bonding costs will result in the manager of a\ncorporation possessing control over some resources which he can allocate (within certain constraints) to\nsatisfy his own preferences.  However, to the extent that he must obtain the cooperation of others in order\nto carry out his tasks (such as divisional vice presidents) and to the extent that he cannot control their\nbehavior perfectly and costlessly they will be able to appropriate some of these resources for their own\nends.  In short, there are agency costs generated at every level of the organization.  Unfortunately, the\nanalysis of these more general organizational issues is even more difficult than that of the ‘ownership and\nJensen and Meckling\n7\n1976\ngovernmental authorities and bureaus, in unions, and in relationships normally classified as agency\nrelationships such as those common in the performing arts and the market for real estate.  The\ndevelopment of theories to explain the form which agency costs take in each of these situations\n(where the contractual relations differ significantly), and how and why they are born will lead to a\nrich theory of organizations which is now lacking in economics and the social sciences generally.\nWe confine our attention in this paper to only a small part of this general problem—the analysis of\nagency costs generated by the contractual arrangements between the owners and top\nmanagement of the corporation.\nOur approach to the agency problem here differs fundamentally from most of the existing\nliterature.  That literature focuses almost exclusively on the normative aspects of the agency\nrelationship; that is, how to structure the contractual relation (including compensation incentives)\nbetween the principal and agent to provide appropriate incentives for the agent to make choices\nwhich will maximize the principal’s welfare, given that uncertainty and imperfect monitoring exist.\nWe focus almost entirely on the positive aspects of the theory.  That is, we assume individuals\nsolve these normative problems, and given that only stocks and bonds can be issued as claims, we\ninvestigate the incentives faced by each of the parties and the elements entering into the\ndetermination of the equilibrium contractual form characterizing the relationship between the\nmanager (i.e., agent) of the firm and the outside equity and debt holders (i.e., principals).\n1.5 General Comments on the Definition of the firm\nRonald Coase in his seminal paper entitled “The Nature of the Firm” (1937) pointed out\nthat economics had no positive theory to determine the bounds of the firm.  He characterized the\ncontrol’ issue because the nature of the contractual obligations and rights of the parties are much more\nvaried and generally not as well specified in explicit contractual arrangements.  Nevertheless, they exist and\nwe believe that extensions of our analysis in these directions show promise of producing insights into a\nviable theory of organization.\nJensen and Meckling\n8\n1976\nbounds of the firm as that range of exchanges over which the market system was suppressed and\nwhere resource allocation was accomplished instead by authority and direction.  He focused on\nthe cost of using markets to effect contracts and exchanges and argued that activities would be\nincluded within the firm whenever the costs of using markets were greater than the costs of using\ndirect authority.  Alchian and Demsetz (1972) object to the notion that activities within the firm are\ngoverned by authority, and correctly emphasize the role of contracts as a vehicle for voluntary\nexchange.  They emphasize the role of monitoring in situations in which there is joint input or team\nproduction.11  We are sympathetic to with the importance they attach to monitoring, but we believe\nthe emphasis that Alchian and Demsetz place on joint input production is too narrow and therefore\nmisleading.  Contractual relations are the essence of the firm, not only with employees but with\nsuppliers, customers, creditors, and so on.  The problem of agency costs and monitoring exists for\nall of these contracts, independent of whether there is joint production in their sense; i.e., joint\nproduction can explain only a small fraction of the behavior of individuals associated with a firm.\nIt is important to recognize that most organizations are simply legal fictions12 which serve\nas a nexus for a set of contracting relationships among individuals.  This includes firms, non-profit\ninstitutions such as universities, hospitals, and foundations, mutual organizations such as mutual\nsavings banks and insurance companies and co-operatives, some private clubs, and even\ngovernmental bodies such as cities, states, and the federal government, government enterprises\nsuch as TVA, the Post Office, transit systems, and so forth.\n11 They define the classical capitalist firm as a contractual organization of inputs in which there is ‘(a) joint\ninput production, (b) several input owners, (c) one party who is common to all the contracts of the joint\ninputs, (d) who has rights to renegotiate any input’s contract independently of contracts with other input\nowners, (e) who holds the residual claim, and (f) who has the right to sell his contractual residual status.’\n12 By legal fiction we mean the artificial construct under the law which allows certain organizations to be\ntreated as individuals.\nJensen and Meckling\n9\n1976\nThe private corporation or firm is simply one form of legal fiction which serves as a nexus\nfor contracting relationships and which is also characterized by the existence of divisible residual\nclaims on the assets and cash flows of the organization which can generally be sold without\npermission of the other contracting individuals.  Although  this definition of the firm has little\nsubstantive content, emphasizing the essential contractual nature of firms and other organizations\nfocuses attention on a crucial set of questions—why particular sets of contractual relations arise\nfor various types of organizations, what the consequences of these contractual relations are, and\nhow they are affected by changes exogenous to the organization.  Viewed this way, it makes little\nor no sense to try to distinguish those things that are “inside” the firm (or any other organization)\nfrom those things that are “outside” of it.  There is in a very real sense only a multitude of\ncomplex relationships (i.e., contracts) between the legal fiction (the firm) and the owners of labor,\nmaterial and capital inputs and the consumers of output.13\nViewing the firm as the nexus of a set of contracting relationships among individuals also\nserves to make it clear that the personalization of the firm implied by asking questions such as\n“what should be the objective function of the firm?” or “does the firm have a social\nresponsibility?” is seriously misleading.  The firm is not an individual.  It is a legal fiction which\nserves as a focus for a complex process in which the conflicting objectives of individuals (some of\nwhom may “represent” other organizations) are brought into equilibrium within a framework of\ncontractual relations.  In this sense the “behavior” of the firm is like the behavior of a market, that\nis, the outcome of a complex equilibrium process.  We seldom fall into the trap of characterizing\n13 For example, we ordinarily think of a product as leaving the firm at the time it is sold, but implicitly or\nexplicitly such sales generally carry with them continuing contracts between the firm and the buyer.  If the\nproduct does not perform as expected the buyer often can and does have a right to satisfaction.  Explicit\nevidence that such implicit contracts do exist is the practice we occasionally observe of specific provision\nthat ‘all sales are final.’\nJensen and Meckling\n10\n1976\nthe wheat or stock market as an individual, but we often make this error by thinking about\norganizations as if they were persons with motivations and intentions.14\n1.6  Overview of the Paper\nWe develop our theory in stages.  Sections 2 and 4 provide analyses of the agency costs\nof equity and debt respectively.  These form the major foundation of the theory.  In Section 3, we\npose some questions regarding the existence of the corporate form of organization and examines\nthe role of limited liability.  Section 5 provides a synthesis of the basic concepts derived in sections\n2-4 into a theory of the corporate ownership structure which takes account of the trade-offs\navailable to the entrepreneur-manager between inside and outside equity and debt.  Some\nqualifications and extensions of the analysis are discussed in section 6, and section 7 contains a\nbrief summary and conclusions.\n2.  The Agency Costs of Outside Equity\n2.1 Overview\nIn this section we analyze the effect of outside equity on agency costs by comparing the\nbehavior of a manager when he owns 100 percent of the residual claims on a firm with his\nbehavior when he sells off a portion of those claims to outsiders.  If a wholly-owned firm is\nmanaged by the owner, he will make operating decisions that maximize his utility.  These decisions\n14 This view of the firm points up the important role which the legal system and the law play in social\norganizations, especially, the organization of economic activity.  Statutory laws sets bounds on the kinds of\ncontracts into which individuals and organizations may enter without risking criminal prosecution.  The\npolice powers of the state are available and used to enforce performance of contracts or to enforce the\ncollection of damages for non-performance. The courts adjudicate conflicts between contracting parties and\nestablish precedents which form the body of common law.  All of these government activities affect both the\nkinds of contracts executed and the extent to which contracting is relied upon.  This in turn determines the\nusefulness, productivity, profitability and viability of various forms of organization.  Moreover, new laws as\nwell as court decisions often can and do change the rights of contracting parties ex post, and they can and\ndo serve as a vehicle for redistribution of wealth.  An analysis of some of the implications of these facts is\ncontained in Jensen and Meckling (1978) and we shall not pursue them here.\nJensen and Meckling\n11\n1976\nwill involve not only the benefits he derives from pecuniary returns but also the utility generated by\nvarious non-pecuniary aspects of his entrepreneurial activities such as the physical appointments\nof the office, the attractiveness of the office staff, the level of employee discipline, the kind and\namount of charitable contributions, personal relations (“friendship,” “respect,” and so on) with\nemployees, a larger than optimal computer to play with, or purchase of production inputs from\nfriends.  The optimum mix (in the absence of taxes) of the various pecuniary and non-pecuniary\nbenefits is achieved when the marginal utility derived from an additional dollar of expenditure\n(measured net of any productive effects) is equal for each non-pecuniary item and equal to the\nmarginal utility derived from an additional dollar of after-tax purchasing power (wealth).\nIf the owner-manager sells equity claims on the corporation which are identical to his own\n(i.e., which share proportionately in the profits of the firm and have limited liability), agency costs\nwill be generated by the divergence between his interest and those of the outside shareholders,\nsince he will then bear only a fraction of the costs of any non-pecuniary benefits he takes out in\nmaximizing his own utility.  If the manager owns only 95 percent of the stock, he will expend\nresources to the point where the marginal utility derived from a dollar’s expenditure of the firm’s\nresources on such items equals the marginal utility of an additional 95 cents in general purchasing\npower (i.e., his share of the wealth reduction) and not one dollar.  Such activities, on his part, can\nbe limited (but probably not eliminated) by the expenditure of resources on monitoring activities by\nthe outside stockholders.  But as we show below, the owner will bear the entire wealth effects of\nthese expected costs so long as the equity market anticipates these effects.  Prospective minority\nshareholders will realize that the owner-manager’s interests will diverge somewhat from theirs;\nhence the price which they will pay for shares will reflect the monitoring costs and the effect of\nthe divergence between the manager’s interest and theirs.  Nevertheless, ignoring for the moment\nthe possibility of borrowing against his wealth, the owner will find it desirable to bear these costs\nJensen and Meckling\n12\n1976\nas long as the welfare increment he experiences from converting his claims on the firm into\ngeneral purchasing power15 is large enough to offset them.\nAs the owner-manager’s fraction of the equity falls, his fractional claim on the outcomes\nfalls and this will tend to encourage him to appropriate larger amounts of the corporate resources\nin the form of perquisites. This also makes it desirable for the minority shareholders to expend\nmore resources in monitoring his behavior.  Thus, the wealth costs to the owner of obtaining\nadditional cash in the equity markets rise as his fractional ownership falls.\nWe shall continue to characterize the agency conflict between the owner-manager and\noutside shareholders as deriving from the manager’s tendency to appropriate perquisites out of the\nfirm’s resources for his own consumption.  However, we do not mean to leave the impression that\nthis is the only or even the most important source of conflict.  Indeed, it is likely that the most\nimportant conflict arises from the fact that as the manager’s ownership claim falls, his incentive to\ndevote significant effort to creative activities such as searching out new profitable ventures falls.\nHe may in fact avoid such ventures simply because it requires too much trouble or effort on his\npart to manage or to learn about new technologies.  Avoidance of these personal costs and the\nanxieties that go with them also represent a source of on-the-job utility to him and it can result in\nthe value of the firm being substantially lower than it otherwise could be.\n2.2 A Simple Formal Analysis of the Sources of Agency Costs of Equity and Who Bears Them\nIn order to develop some structure for the analysis to follow we make two sets of\nassumptions.  The first set (permanent assumptions) are those which will carry through almost all\nof the analysis in sections 2-5.  The effects of relaxing some of these are discussed in section 6.\n15 For use in consumption, for the diversification of his wealth, or more importantly, for the financing of\n‘profitable’ projects which he could not otherwise finance out of his personal wealth.  We deal with these\nissues below after having developed some of the elementary analytical tools necessary to their solution.\nJensen and Meckling\n13\n1976\nThe second set (temporary assumptions) are made only for expositional purposes and are relaxed\nas soon as the basic points have been clarified.\nPermanent assumptions\n(P.1)\nAll taxes are zero.\n(P.2)\nNo trade credit is available.\n(P.3)\nAll outside equity shares are non-voting.\n(P.4)\nNo complex financial claims such as convertible bonds or preferred stock or\nwarrants can be issued.\n(P.5)\nNo outside owner gains utility from ownership in a firm in any way other than\nthrough its effect on his wealth or cash flows.\n(P.6)\nAll dynamic aspects of the multiperiod nature of the problem are ignored by\nassuming there is only one production-financing decision to be made by the\nentrepreneur.\n(P.7)\nThe entrepreneur-manager’s money wages are held constant throughout the\nanalysis.\n(P.8)\nThere exists a single manager (the peak coordinator) with ownership interest in\nthe firm.\nTemporary assumptions\n(T.1)\nThe size of the firm is fixed.\n(T.2)\nNo monitoring or bonding activities are possible.\n(T.3)\nNo debt financing through bonds, preferred stock, or personal borrowing (secured\nor unsecured) is possible.\nJensen and Meckling\n14\n1976\n(T.4)\nAll elements of the owner-manager’s decision problem involving portfolio\nconsiderations induced by the presence of uncertainty and the existence of\ndiversifiable risk are ignored.\nDefine:\nX\n=\n{x1, x2, . . .,xn} = vector of quantities of all factors and activities within the\nfirm from which the manager derives non-pecuniary benefits;16 the xi are defined\nsuch that his marginal utility is positive for each of them;\nC(X)\n=\ntotal dollar cost of providing any given amount of these items;\nP(X)\n=\ntotal dollar value to the firm of the productive benefits of X;\nB(X)\n=\nP(X)-C(X) = net dollar benefit to the firm of X ignoring any effects of X on\nthe equilibrium wage of the manager.\nIgnoring the effects of X on the manager’s utility and therefore on his equilibrium wage\nrate, the optimum levels of the factors and activities X are defined by X* such\nthat\n∂B(X*)\n∂X *\n =  ∂P(X*)\n∂X *\n − ∂C(X*)\n∂X *\n =  0.\nThus for any vector X ≥ X* (i.e., where at least one element of X is greater than its\ncorresponding element of X*), F ≡ B(X*) - B(X) > 0 measures the dollar cost to the firm (net of\nany productive effects) of providing the increment X - X* of the factors and activities which\ngenerate utility to the manager.  We assume henceforth that for any given level of cost to the firm,\nF, the vector of factors and activities on which F is spent on those, ˆ X , which yield the manager\nmaximum utility.  Thus F ≡ B(X*) - B( ˆ X ).\n16  Such as office space, air conditioning, thickness of the carpets, friendliness of employee relations, etc.\nJensen and Meckling\n15\n1976\nWe have thus far ignored in our discussion the fact that these expenditures on X occur\nthrough time and therefore there are trade-offs to be made across time as well as between\nalternative elements of X.  Furthermore, we have ignored the fact that the future expenditures are\nlikely to involve uncertainty (i.e., they are subject to probability distributions) and therefore some\nallowance must be made for their riskiness.  We resolve both of these issues by defining C, P, B,\nand F to be the current market values of the sequence of probability distributions on the period-\nby-period cash flows involved.17\nGiven the definition of F as the current market value of the stream of manager’s\nexpenditures on non-pecuniary benefits, we represent the constraint which a single owner-\nmanager faces in deciding how much non-pecuniary income he will extract from the firm by the\nline V F in fig. 1.  This is analogous to a budget constraint.  The market value of the firm is\nmeasured along the vertical axis and the market value of the manager’s stream of expenditures on\nnon-pecuniary benefits, F, is measured along the horizontal axis.  OV  is the value of the firm\nwhen the amount of non-pecuniary income consumed is zero.  By definition V  is the maximum\nmarket value of the cash flows generated by the firm for a given money wage for the manager\nwhen the manager’s consumption of non-pecuniary benefits are zero.  At this point all the factors\nand activities within the firm which generate utility for the manager are at the level X* defined\nabove.  There is a different budget constraint V F for each possible scale of the firm (i.e., level of\ninvestment, I) and for alternative levels of money wage, W, for the manager.  For the moment we\npick an arbitrary level of investment (which we assume has already been made) and hold the\nscale of the firm constant at this level.  We also assume that the manager’s money wage is fixed\n17 And again we assume that for any given market value of these costs, F, to the firm the allocation across\ntime and across alternative probability distributions is such that the manager’s current expected utility is at a\nmaximum.\nJensen and Meckling\n16\n1976\nat the level W* which represents the current market value of his wage contract18 in the optimal\ncompensation package which consists of both wages, W*, and non-pecuniary benefits, F*.  Since\none dollar of current value of non-pecuniary benefits withdrawn from the firm by the manager\nreduces the market value of the firm by $1, by definition, the slope of V F is -1.\nThe owner-manager’s tastes for wealth and non-pecuniary benefits is represented in fig.\n1 by a system of indifference curves, U1, U2, and so on.19  The indifference curves will be convex\nas drawn as long as the owner-manager’s marginal rate of substitution between non-pecuniary\nbenefits and wealth diminishes with increasing levels of the benefits. For the 100 percent owner-\nmanager, this presumes that there are not perfect substitutes for these benefits available on the\noutside, that is, to some extent they are job-specific.  For the fractional owner-manager this\npresumes that the benefits cannot be turned into general purchasing power at a constant price.20\nWhen the owner has 100 percent of the equity, the value of the firm will be V* where\nindifference curve U2 is tangent to VF, and the level of non-pecuniary benefits consumed is F*.\nIf the owner sells the entire equity but remains as manager, and if the equity buyer can, at zero\n18 At this stage when we are considering a 100% owner-managed firm the notion of a ‘wage contract’ with\nhimself has no content.  However, the 100% owner-managed case is only an expositional device used in\npassing to illustrate a number of points in the analysis, and we ask the reader to bear with us briefly while\nwe lay out the structure for the more interesting partial ownership case where such a contract does have\nsubstance.\n19 The manager’s utility function is actually defined over wealth and the future time sequence of vectors of\nquantities of non-pecuniary benefits, Xt.  Although the setting of his problem is somewhat different, Fama\n(1970b, 1972) analyzes the conditions under which these preferences can be represented as a derived utility\nfunction defined as a function of the money value of the expenditures (in our notation F) on these goods\nconditional on the prices of goods.  Such a utility function incorporates the optimization going on in the\nbackground which define ˆ\nX  discussed above for a given F.  In the more general case where we allow a time\nseries of consumption, ˆ\nX t, the optimization is being carried out across both time and the components of Xt\nfor fixed F.\n20 This excludes, for instance, (a) the case where the manager is allowed to expend corporate resources on\nanything he pleases in which case F would be a perfect substitute for wealth, or (b) the case where he can\n‘steal’ cash (or other marketable assets) with constant returns to scale—if he could the indifference curves\nwould be straight lines with slope determined by the fence commission.\nJensen and Meckling\n17\n1976\ncost, force the old owner (as manager) to take the same level of non-pecuniary benefits as he did\nas owner, then V* is the price the new owner will be willing to pay for the entire equity.21\nFig. 1.\nThe value of the firm (V) and the level of non-pecuniary benefits consumed (F) when the fraction\nof outside equity is (1-α)V, and Uj(j = 1,2,3) represents owner’s indifference curves between wealth and\nnon-pecuniary benefits.\n21 Point D defines the fringe benefits in the optimal pay package since the value to the manager of the fringe\nbenefits F* is greater than the cost of providing them as is evidenced by the fact that U2 is steeper to the\nleft of D than the budget constraint with slope equal to -1.\nThat D is indeed the optimal pay package can easily be seen in this situation since if the conditions of the\nsale to a new owner specified that the manager would receive no fringe benefits after the sale he would\nrequire a payment equal to V3 to compensate him for the sacrifice of his claims to V* and fringe benefits\namounting to F* (the latter with total value to him of V3-V*).  But if F = 0, the value of the firm is only V .\nTherefore, if monitoring costs were zero the sale would take place at V* with provision for a pay package\nwhich included fringe benefits of F* for the manager.\nThis discussion seems to indicate there are two values for the ‘firm’, V3 and V*.  This is not the case if we\nrealize that V* is the value of the right to be the residual claimant on the cash flows of the firm and V3-V* is\nthe value of the managerial rights, i.e., the right to make the operating decisions which include access to F*.\nThere is at least one other right which has value which plays no formal role in the analysis as yet—the value\nof the control right.  By control right we mean the right to hire and fire the manager and we leave this issue\nto a future paper.\nJensen and Meckling\n18\n1976\nIn general, however, we could not expect the new owner to be able to enforce identical\nbehavior on the old owner at zero costs.  If the old owner sells a fraction of the firm to an\noutsider, he, as manager, will no longer bear the full cost of any non-pecuniary benefits he\nconsumes.  Suppose the owner sells a share of the firm, 1-α, (0 < α < 1) and retains for himself a\nshare, α.  If the prospective buyer believes that the owner-manager will consume the same level\nof non-pecuniary benefits as he did as full owner, the buyer will be willing to pay (1-α)V* for a\nfraction (1-α) of the equity.  Given that an outsider now holds a claim to (1-α) of the equity,\nhowever, the cost to the owner-manager of consuming $1 of non-pecuniary benefits in the firm\nwill no longer be $1.  Instead, it will be α x $1.  If the prospective buyer actually paid (1-α)V* for\nhis share of the equity, and if thereafter the manager could choose whatever level of non-\npecuniary benefits he liked, his budget constraint would be V1P1 in fig. 1 and has a slope equal to -\nα,  Including the payment the owner receives from the buyer as part of the owner’s post-sale\nwealth, his budget constraint, V1P1, must pass through D, since he can if he wishes have the same\nwealth and level of non-pecuniary consumption he enjoyed as full owner.\nBut if the owner-manager is free to choose the level of perquisites, F, subject only to the\nloss in wealth he incurs as a part owner, his welfare will be maximized by increasing his\nconsumption of non-pecuniary benefits.  He will move to point A where V1P1 is tangent to U1\nrepresenting a higher level of utility.  The value of the firm falls from V*, to V0, that is, by the\namount of the cost to the firm of the increased non-pecuniary expenditures, and the owner-\nmanager’s consumption of non-pecuniary benefits rises from F* to F0.\nIf the equity market is characterized by rational expectations the buyers will be aware that\nthe owner will increase his non-pecuniary consumption when his ownership share is reduced.  If\nthe owner’s response function is known or if the equity market makes unbiased estimates of the\nJensen and Meckling\n19\n1976\nowner’s response to the changed incentives, the buyer will not pay (1-α)V* for (1-α) of the\nequity.\nTheorem.  For a claim on the firm of (1-α) the outsider will pay only (1-α) times the\nvalue he expects the firm to have given the induced change in the behavior of the owner-manager.\nProof.  For simplicity we ignore any element of uncertainty introduced by the lack of\nperfect knowledge of the owner-manager’s response function.  Such uncertainty will not affect\nthe final solution if the equity market is large as long as the estimates are rational (i.e., unbiased)\nand the errors are independent across firms.  The latter condition assures that this risk is\ndiversifiable and therefore that equilibrium prices will equal the expected values.\nLet W represent the owner’s total wealth after he has sold a claim equal to 1-α of the\nequity to an outsider.  W has two components.  One is the payment, So, made by the outsider for\n1-α of the equity; the rest, Si, is the value of the owner’s (i.e., insider’s) share of the firm, so that\nW, the owner’s wealth, is given by\nW  = So + Si = So + αV(F, α),\nwhere V(F, α) represents the value of the firm given that the manager’s fractional\nownership share is α and that he consumes perquisites with current market value of F.  Let V2P2,\nwith a slope of -α represent the trade-off the owner-manager faces between non-pecuniary\nbenefits and his wealth after the sale.  Given that the owner has decided to sell a claim 1-α of the\nfirm, his welfare will be maximized when V2P2 is tangent to some indifference curve such as U3 in\nfig. 1.  A price for a claim of (1-α) on the firm that is satisfactory to both the buyer and the seller\nwill require that this tangency occur along V F, that is, that the value of the firm must be V’.  To\nshow this, assume that such is not the case—that the tangency occurs to the left of the point B on\nthe line V F.  Then, since the slope of V2P2 is negative, the value of the firm will be larger than V’.\nJensen and Meckling\n20\n1976\nThe owner-manager’s choice of this lower level of consumption of non-pecuniary benefits will\nimply a higher value both to the firm as a whole and to the fraction of the firm (1-α) which the\noutsider has acquired; that is, (1-α)V’ > So.  From the owner’s viewpoint, he has sold 1-α of the\nfirm for less than he could have, given the (assumed) lower level of non-pecuniary benefits he\nenjoys.  On the other hand, if the tangency point B is to the right of the line V F, the owner-\nmanager’s higher consumption of non-pecuniary benefits means the value of the firm is less than\nV’, and hence (1-α)V(F, α) < So = (1-α)V’.  The outside owner then has paid more for his share\nof the equity than it is worth.  So will be a mutually satisfactory price if and only if (1-α)V’ = So.\nBut this means that the owner’s post-sale wealth is equal to the (reduced) value of the firm V’,\nsince\nW = So + αV’ = (1-α)V’ + aV’ = V’.\nQ.E.D.\nThe requirement that V’ and F’ fall on V F is thus equivalent to requiring that the value of\nthe claim acquired by the outside buyer be equal to the amount he pays for it, and conversely for\nthe owner.  This means that the decline in the total value of the firm (V*-V’) is entirely\nimposed on the owner-manager.  His total wealth after the sale of (1-α) of the equity is V’ and\nthe decline in his wealth is V*-V’.\nThe distance V*-V’ is the reduction in the market value of the firm engendered by the\nagency relationship and is a measure of the “residual loss” defined earlier.  In this simple example\nthe residual loss represents the total agency costs engendered by the sale of outside equity\nbecause monitoring and bonding activities have not been allowed.  The welfare loss the owner\nincurs is less than the residual loss by the value to him of the increase in non-pecuniary benefits\n(F’-F*).  In fig. 1 the difference between the intercepts on the Y axis of the two indifference\nJensen and Meckling\n21\n1976\ncurves U2 and U3 is a measure of the owner-manager’s welfare loss due to the incurrence of\nagency costs,22 and he would sell such a claim only if the increment in welfare he achieved by\nusing the cash amounting to (1-α)V’ for other things was worth more to him than this amount of\nwealth.\n2.3 Determination of the Optimal Scale of the Firm\nThe case of all equity financing.  Consider the problem faced by an entrepreneur with\ninitial pecuniary wealth, W, and monopoly access to a project requiring investment outlay, I, subject\nto diminishing returns to scale in I.  Fig. 2 portrays the solution to the optimal scale of the firm\ntaking into account the agency costs associated with the existence of outside equity.  The axes are\nas defined in fig. 1 except we now plot on the vertical axis the total wealth of the owner, that is,\nhis initial wealth, W, plus V(I)-I, the net increment in wealth he obtains from exploitation of his\ninvestment opportunities.  The market value of the firm, V = V(I,F), is now a function of the level\nof investment, I, and the current market value of the manager’s expenditures of the firm’s\nresources on non-pecuniary benefits, F.  Let V (I)  represent the value of the firm as a function of\nthe level of investment when the manager’s expenditures on non-pecuniary benefits, F, are zero.\nThe schedule with intercept labeled W  + [V (I*)−I*)] and slope equal to -1 in fig. 2 represents the\nlocus of combinations of post-investment wealth and dollar cost to thefirm of non-pecuniary\nbenefits which are available to the manager when investment is carried to the value maximizing\npoint, I*.  At this point ∆V (I) −∆I  =  0 .  If the manager’s wealth were large enough to cover the\ninvestment required to reach this scale of operation, I*, he would consume F* in non-pecuniary\n22 The distance V*-V’ is a measure of what we will define as the gross agency costs.  The distance V3-V4 is a\nmeasure of what we call net agency costs, and it is this measure of agency costs which will be minimized by\nthe manager in the general case where we allow investment to change.\nJensen and Meckling\n22\n1976\nbenefits and have pecuniary wealth with value W + V*-I*.  However, if outside financing is\nrequired to cover the investment he will not reach this point if monitoring costs are non-zero.23\nThe expansion path OZBC represents the equilibrium combinations of wealth and non-\npecuniary benefits, F, which the manager could obtain if he had enough personal wealth to finance\nall levels of investment up to I*.  It is the locus of points such as Z and C which present the\nequilibrium position for the 100 percent owner-manager at each possible level of investment, I.  As\nI increases we move up the expansion path to the point C where V(I)-I is at a maximum.\nAdditional investment beyond this point reduces the net value of the firm, and as it does the\nequilibrium path of the manager’s wealth and non-pecuniary benefits retraces (in the reverse\ndirection) the curve OZBC.  We draw the path as a smooth concave function only as a matter of\nconvenience.\nFig. 2.\nDetermination of the optimal scale of the firm in the case where no monitoring takes place.  Point C\ndenotes optimum investment, I*, and non-pecuniary benefits, F*, when investment is 100% financed by\nentrepreneur.  Point D denotes optimum investment, I’, and non-pecuniary benefits, F, when outside equity\nfinancing is used to help finance the investment and the entrepreneur owns a fraction α‘ of the firm.  The\ndistance A measures the gross agency costs.\n23 I* is the value maximizing and Pareto Optimum investment level which results from the traditional analysis\nof the corporate investment decision if the firm operates in perfectly competitive capital and product markets\nand the agency cost problems discussed here are ignored.  See Debreu (1959, ch. 7), Jensen and Long\n(1972), Long (1972), Merton and Subrahmanyam (1974), Hirshleifer (1958, 1970), and Fama and Miller (1972).\nJensen and Meckling\n23\n1976\nIf the manager obtained outside financing and if there were zero costs to the agency\nrelationship (perhaps because monitoring costs were zero), the expansion path would also be\nrepresented by OZBC.  Therefore, this path represents what we might call the “idealized”\nsolutions, that is, those which would occur in the absence of agency costs.\nAssume the manager has sufficient personal wealth to completely finance the firm only up\nto investment level I1, which puts him at point Z.  At this point W = I1.  To increase the size of the\nfirm beyond this point he must obtain outside financing to cover the additional investment required,\nand this means reducing his fractional ownership. When he does this he incurs agency costs, and\nthe lower his ownership fraction, the larger are the agency costs he incurs.  However, if the\ninvestments requiring outside financing are sufficiently profitable his welfare will continue to\nincrease.\nThe expansion path ZEDHL in fig. 2 portrays one possible path of the equilibrium levels of\nthe owner’s non-pecuniary benefits and wealth at each possible level of investment higher than I1.\nThis path is the locus of points such as E or D where (1) the manager’s indifference curve is\ntangent to a line with slope equal to -α (his fractional claim on the firm at that level of investment),\nand (2) the tangency occurs on the “budget constraint” with slope = -1 for the firm value and non-\npecuniary benefit trade-off at the same level of investment.24  As we move along ZEDHL his\n24 Each equilibrium point such as that at E is characterized by ( ˆ\nα , ˆ\nF ,\nc\nWτ ) where\nc\nWτ  is the entrepreneur’s\npost-investment financing wealth.  Such an equilibrium must satisfy each of the following four conditions:\n(1)\nc\nWτ + F  =  V (I) + W −I  =  V (I) −K,\nwhere K ≡ I-W is the amount of outside financing required to make the investment I.  If this condition is not\nsatisfied there is an uncompensated wealth transfer (in one direction or the other) between the entrepreneur\nand outside equity buyers.\n(2)\nF\nU\n(\nc\nWτ , ˆ\nF )/\nWτ\nU\n(\nc\nWτ , ˆ\nF )  =  ˆ\nα ,\nwhere U is the entrepreneur’s utility function on wealth and perquisites,\nF\nU\n and\nWτ\nU\n are marginal utilities\nand ˆ\nα  is the manager’s share of the firm.\nJensen and Meckling\n24\n1976\nfractional claim on the firm continues to fall as he raises larger amounts of outside capital.  This\nexpansion path represents his complete opportunity set for combinations of wealth and non-\npecuniary benefits, given the existence of the costs of the agency relationship with the outside\nequity holders.  Point D, where this opportunity set is tangent to an indifference curve, represents\nthe solution which maximizes his welfare.  At this point, the level of investments is I’, his fractional\nownership share in the firm is α‘, his wealth is W+V’-I’, and he consumes a stream of non-\npecuniary benefits with current market value of F’.  The gross agency costs (denoted by A) are\nequal to (V*-I*)-(V’-I’).  Given that no monitoring is possible, I’ is the socially optimal level of\ninvestment as well as the privately optimal level.\nWe can characterize the optimal level of investment as that point, I’ which satisfies the\nfollowing condition for small changes:\n\u001fV - \u001fI + α‘\u001fF = 0\n(1)\n\u001fV-\u001fI is the change in the net market value of the firm, and α‘\u001fF is the dollar value to\nthe manager of the incremental fringe benefits he consumes (which cost the firm \u001fF dollars).25\nFurthermore, recognizing that V  =  V −F,  where  V  is the value of the firm at any level of\ninvestment when F = 0, we can substitute into the optimum condition to get\n(3)\n(1 −ˆ\nα )V(I)  =  (1 −ˆ\nα )[V (I) −ˆ\nF ] ≥ K,\nwhich says the funds received from outsiders are at least equal to K, the minimum required outside\nfinancing.\n(4) Among all points ( ˆ\nα , ˆ\nF ,\nc\nWτ ) satisfying conditions (1)-(3), (α, F,\nτ\nW )  gives the manager highest utility.\nThis implies that ( ˆ\nα , ˆ\nF ,\nc\nWτ ) satisfy condition (3) as an equality.\n25 Proof.  Note that the slope of the expansion path (or locus of equilibrium points) at any point is (\u001fV-\n\u001fI)/\u001fF and at the optimum level of investment this must be equal to the slope of the manager’s indifference\ncurve between wealth and market value of fringe benefits, F.  Furthermore, in the absence of monitoring, the\nslope of the indifference curve, \u001fW\u001fF, at the equilibrium point, D, must be equal to -α‘.  Thus,\n(\u001fV-\u001fI)/\u001fF = -α‘\n(2)\nJensen and Meckling\n25\n1976\n(∆V −∆I) − 1−α' )∆F  =  0 (3)\nas an alternative expression for determining the optimum level of investment.\nThe idealized or zero agency cost solution, I*, is given by the condition (∆V −∆I) =  0 ,\nand since \u001fF is positive the actual welfare maximizing level of investment I’ will be less than I*,\nbecause (∆V −∆I)   must be positive at I’ if (3) is to be satisfied.  Since -α‘ is the slope of the\nindifference curve at the optimum and therefore represents the manager’s demand price for\nincremental non-pecuniary benefits, \u001fF, we know that α‘\u001fF is the dollar value to him of an\nincrement of fringe benefits costing the firm \u001fF dollars.  The term (1-α‘)\u001fF thus measures the\ndollar “loss” to the firm (and himself) of an additional \u001fF dollars spent on non-pecuniary benefits.\nThe term ∆V −∆I  is the gross increment in the value of the firm ignoring any changes in the\nconsumption of non-pecuniary benefits.  Thus, the manager stops increasing the size of the firm\nwhen the gross increment in value is just offset by the incremental “loss” involved in the\nconsumption of additional fringe benefits due to his declining fractional interest in the firm.26\nis the condition for the optimal scale of investment and this implies condition (1) holds for small changes at\nthe optimum level of investment, I’.\n26 Since the manager’s indifference curves are negatively sloped we know that the optimum scale of the firm,\npoint D, will occur in the region where the expansion path has negative slope, i.e., the market value of the\nfirm, will be declining and the gross agency costs, A, will be increasing and thus, the manager will not\nminimize them in making the investment decision (even though he will minimize them for any given level of\ninvestment).  However, we define the net agency cost as the dollar equivalent of the welfare loss the\nmanager experiences because of the agency relationship evaluated at F = 0 (the vertical distance between\nthe intercepts on the Y axis of the two indifference curves on which points C and D lie).  The optimum\nsolution, I’, does satisfy the condition that net agency costs are minimized.  But this simply amounts to a\nrestatement of the assumption that the manager maximizes his welfare.\nFinally, it is possible for the solution point D to be a corner solution and in this case the value of the firm\nwill not be declining.  Such a corner solution can occur, for instance, if the manager’s marginal rate of\nsubstitution between F and wealth falls to zero fast enough as we move up the expansion path, or if the\ninvestment projects are “sufficiently” profitable.  In these cases the expansion path will have a corner which\nlies on the maximum value budget constraint with intercept V (I*) −I * , and the level of investment will be\nequal to the idealized optimum, I*.  However, the market value of the residual claims will be less than V*\nbecause the manager’s consumption of perquisites will be larger than F*, the zero agency cost level.\nJensen and Meckling\n26\n1976\n2.4 The Role of Monitoring and Bonding Activities in Reducing Agency Costs\nIn the above analysis we have ignored the potential for controlling the behavior of the\nowner-manager through monitoring and other control activities.  In practice, it is usually possible\nby expending resources to alter the opportunity the owner-manager has for capturing non-\npecuniary benefits. These methods include auditing, formal control systems, budget restrictions,\nthe establishment of incentive compensation systems which serve to identify the manager’s\ninterests more closely with those of the outside equity holders, and so forth.  Fig. 3 portrays the\neffects of monitoring and other control activities in the simple situation portrayed in fig. 1.  Figs. 1\nand 3 are identical except for the curve BCE in fig. 3 which depicts a “budget constraint” derived\nwhen monitoring possibilities are taken into account.  Without monitoring, and with outside equity\nof (1-α), the value of the firm will be V’ and non-pecuniary expenditures F’.  By incurring\nmonitoring costs, M, the equity holders can restrict the manager’s consumption of perquisites to\namounts less than F’.  Let F(M, α) denote the maximum perquisites the manager can consume\nfor alternative levels of monitoring expenditures, M, given his ownership share α.  We assume\nthat increases in monitoring reduce F, and reduce it at a decreasing rate, that is, ∂F/∂M < 0 and\n∂2F/∂M2 > 0.\nSince the current value of expected future monitoring expenditures by the outside equity\nholders reduce the value of any given claim on the firm to them dollar for dollar, the outside equity\nholders will take this into account in determining the maximum price they will pay for any given\nfraction of the firm’s equity.  Therefore, given positive monitoring activity the value of the firm is\ngiven by V  =  V −F(M,α) −M and the locus of these points for various levels of M and for a\ngiven level of α lie on the line BCE in fig. 3.  The vertical difference between the V F and BCE\ncurves is M, the current market value of the future monitoring expenditures.\nJensen and Meckling\n27\n1976\nIf it is possible for the outside equity holders to make these monitoring expenditures and\nthereby to impose the reductions in the owner-manager’s consumption of F, he will voluntarily\nenter into a contract with the outside equity holders which gives them the rights to restrict his\nconsumption of non-pecuniary items to F”.  He finds this desirable because it will cause the value\nof the firm to rise to V”  Given the contract, the optimal monitoring expenditure on the part of the\noutsiders, M, is the amount D-C.  The entire increase in the value of the firm that accrues will be\nreflected in the owner’s wealth, but his welfare will be increased by less than this because he\nforgoes some non-pecuniary benefits he previously enjoyed.\nFig. 3.\nThe value of the firm (V) and level of non-pecuniary benefits (F) when outside equity is (1-α), U1,\nU2, U3 represent owner’s indifference curves between wealth and non-pecuniary benefits, and monitoring\n(or bonding) activities impose opportunity set BCE as the tradeoff constraint facing the owner.\nJensen and Meckling\n28\n1976\nIf the equity market is competitive and makes unbiased estimates of the effects of\nmonitoring expenditures on F and V, potential buyers will be indifferent between the following two\ncontracts:\nPurchase of a share (1-α) of the firm at a total price of (1-α)V’ and no rights to monitor\nor control the manager’s consumption of perquisites.\nPurchase of a share (1-α) of the firm at a total price of (1-α)V” and the right to expend\nresources up to an amount equal to D-C which will limit the owner-manager’s consumption of\nperquisites to F”.\nGiven the contract (ii) the outside shareholders would find it desirable to monitor to the full\nrights of their contract because it will pay them to do so.  However, if the equity market is\ncompetitive the total benefits (net of the monitoring costs) will be capitalized into the price of the\nclaims.  Thus, not surprisingly, the owner-manager reaps all the benefits of the opportunity to write\nand sell the monitoring contract.27\nAn analysis of bonding expenditures.  We can also see from the analysis of fig. 3 that\nit makes no difference who actually makes the monitoring expenditures—the owner bears the full\namount of these costs as a wealth reduction in all cases.  Suppose that the owner-manager could\nexpend resources to guarantee to the outside equity holders that he would limit his activities which\n27 The careful reader will note that point C will be the equilibrium point only if the contract between the\nmanager and outside equity holders specifies with no ambiguity that they have the right to monitor to limit\nhis consumption of perquisites to an amount no less than F”.  If any ambiguity regarding these rights exists\nin this contract then another source of agency costs arises which is symmetrical to our original problem.  If\nthey could do so the outside equity holders would monitor to the point where the net value of their\nholdings, (1-α)V-M, was maximized, and this would occur when (∂V/∂M)(1-α)-1 = 0 which would be at some\npoint between points C and E in fig. 3.  Point E denotes the point where the value of the firm net of the\nmonitoring costs is at a maximum, i.e., where ∂V/∂M-1 = 0.  But the manager would be worse off than in the\nzero monitoring solution if the point where (1-α)V-M was at a maximum were to the left of the intersection\nbetween BCE and the indifference curve U3 passing through point B (which denotes the zero monitoring\nlevel of welfare).  Thus if the manager could not eliminate enough of the ambiguity in the contract to push\nthe equilibrium to the right of the intersection of the curve BCE with indifference curve U3 he would not\nengage in any contract which allowed monitoring.\nJensen and Meckling\n29\n1976\ncost the firm F.  We call these expenditures “bonding costs,” and they would take such forms as\ncontractual guarantees to have the financial accounts audited by a public account, explicit bonding\nagainst malfeasance on the part of the manager, and contractual limitations on the manager’s\ndecision-making power (which impose costs on the firm because they limit his ability to take full\nadvantage of some profitable opportunities as well as limiting his ability to harm the stockholders\nwhile making himself better off).\nIf the incurrence of the bonding costs were entirely under the control of the manager and\nif they yielded the same opportunity set BCE for him in fig. 3, he would incur them in amount D-C.\nThis would limit his consumption of perquisites to F”from F’, and the solution is exactly the same\nas if the outside equity holders had performed the monitoring.  The manager finds it in his interest\nto incur these costs as long as the net increments in his wealth which they generate (by reducing\nthe agency costs and therefore increasing the value of the firm) are more valuable than the\nperquisites given up.  This optimum occurs at point C in both cases under our assumption that the\nbonding expenditures yield the same opportunity set as the monitoring expenditures.  In general, of\ncourse, it will pay the owner-manager to engage in bonding activities and to write contracts which\nallow monitoring as long as the marginal benefits of each are greater than their marginal cost.\nOptimal scale of the firm in the presence of monitoring and bonding activities.  If\nwe allow the outside owners to engage in (costly) monitoring activities to limit the manager’s\nexpenditures on non-pecuniary benefits and allow the manager to engage in bonding activities to\nguarantee to the outside owners that he will limit his consumption of F we get an expansion path\nsuch as that illustrated in fig. 4 on which Z and G lie.  We have assumed in drawing fig. 4 that the\ncost functions involved in monitoring and bonding are such that some positive levels of the\nactivities are desirable, i.e., yield benefits greater than their cost.  If this is not true the expansion\npath generated by the expenditure of resources on these activities would lie below ZD and no such\nJensen and Meckling\n30\n1976\nactivity would take place at any level of investment.  Points Z, C, and D and the two expansion\npaths they lie on are identical to those portrayed in fig. 2.  Points Z and C lie on the 100 percent\nownership expansion path, and points Z and D lie on the fractional ownership, zero monitoring and\nbonding activity expansion path.\nThe path on which points Z and G lie is the one given by the locus of equilibrium points for\nalternative levels of investment characterized by the point labeled C in fig. 3 which denotes the\noptimal level of monitoring and bonding activity and resulting values of the firm and non-pecuniary\nbenefits to the manager given a fixed level of investment.  If any monitoring or bonding is cost\neffective the expansion path on which Z and G lie must be above the non-monitoring expansion\npath over some range.  Furthermore, if it lies anywhere to the right of the indifference curve\npassing through point D (the zero monitoring-bonding solution) the final solution to the problem will\ninvolve positive amounts of monitoring and/or bonding activities.  Based on the discussion above\nwe know that as long as the contracts between the manager and outsiders are unambiguous\nregarding the rights of the respective parties the final solution will be at that point where the new\nexpansion path is just tangent to the highest indifference curve.  At this point the optimal level of\nmonitoring and bonding expenditures are M” and b”; the manager’s post-investment-financing\nwealth is given by W + V”-I”-M”-b” and his non-pecuniary benefits are F”.  The total gross\nagency costs, A, are given by A(M”, b”, α“, I”) = (V*-I*) - (V”-I”-M”-b”).\n2.5 Pareto Optimality and Agency Costs in Manager-Operated Firms\nIn general we expect to observe both bonding and external monitoring activities, and the\nincentives are such that the levels of these activities will satisfy the conditions of efficiency. They\nwill not, however, result in the firm being run in a manner so as to maximize its value.  The\ndifference between V*, the efficient solution under zero monitoring and bonding costs (and\nJensen and Meckling\n31\n1976\ntherefore zero agency costs), and V”, the value of the firm given positive monitoring costs, are the\ntotal gross agency costs defined earlier in the introduction.  These are the costs of the “separation\nof ownership and control” which Adam Smith focused on in the passage quoted at the beginning\nof this paper and which Berle and Means (1932) popularized 157 years later. The solutions\noutlined above to our highly simplified problem imply that agency costs will be positive as long as\nmonitoring costs are positive—which they certainly are.\nFig. 4.\nDetermination of optimal scale of the firm allowing for monitoring and bonding activities.  Optimal\nmonitoring costs are M” and bonding costs are b” and the equilibrium scale of firm, manager’s wealth and\nconsumption of non-pecuniary benefits are at point G.\nThe reduced value of the firm caused by the manager’s consumption of perquisites\noutlined above is “non-optimal” or inefficient only in comparison to a world in which we could\nobtain compliance of the agent to the principal’s wishes at zero cost or in comparison to a\nhypothetical world in which the agency costs were lower.  But these costs (monitoring and\nbonding costs and ‘residual loss’) are an unavoidable result of the agency relationship.\nJensen and Meckling\n32\n1976\nFurthermore, since they are borne entirely by the decision maker (in this case the original owner)\nresponsible for creating the relationship he has the incentives to see that they are minimized\n(because he captures the benefits from their reduction).  Furthermore, these agency costs will be\nincurred only if the benefits to the owner-manager from their creation are great enough to\noutweigh them.  In our current example these benefits arise from the availability of profitable\ninvestments requiring capital investment in excess of the original owner’s personal wealth.\nIn conclusion, finding that agency costs are non-zero (i.e., that there are costs associated\nwith the separation of ownership and control in the corporation) and concluding therefrom that the\nagency relationship is non-optimal, wasteful or inefficient is equivalent in every sense to comparing\na world in which iron ore is a scarce commodity (and therefore costly) to a world in which it is\nfreely available at zero resource costs, and concluding that the first world is “non-optimal”—a\nperfect example of the fallacy criticized by Coase (1964) and what Demsetz (1969) characterizes\nas the “Nirvana” form of analysis.28\n2.6 Factors Affecting the Size of the Divergence from Ideal Maximization\nThe magnitude of the agency costs discussed above will vary from firm to firm.  It will\ndepend on the tastes of managers, the ease with which they can exercise their own preferences\nas opposed to value maximization in decision making, and the costs of monitoring and bonding\nactivities.29  The agency costs will also depend upon the cost of measuring the manager’s\n(agent’s) performance and evaluating it, the cost of devising and applying an index for\n28 If we could establish the existence of a feasible set of alternative institutional arrangements which would\nyield net benefits from the reduction of these costs we could legitimately conclude the agency relationship\nengendered by the corporation was not Pareto optimal.  However, we would then be left with the problem of\nexplaining why these alternative institutional arrangements have not replaced the corporate form of\norganization.\n29 The monitoring and bonding costs will differ from firm to firm depending on such things as the inherent\ncomplexity and geographical dispersion of operations, the attractiveness of perquisites available in the firm\n(consider the mint), etc.\nJensen and Meckling\n33\n1976\ncompensating the manager which correlates with the owner’s (principal’s) welfare, and the cost\nof devising and enforcing specific behavioral rules or policies.  Where the manager has less than a\ncontrolling interest in the firm, it will also depend upon the market for managers.  Competition\nfrom other potential managers limits the costs of obtaining managerial services (including the\nextent to which a given manager can diverge from the idealized solution which would obtain if all\nmonitoring and bonding costs were zero).  The size of the divergence (the agency costs) will be\ndirectly related to the cost of replacing the manager.  If his responsibilities require very little\nknowledge specialized to the firm, if it is easy to evaluate his performance, and if replacement\nsearch costs are modest, the divergence from the ideal will be relatively small and vice versa.\nThe divergence will also be constrained by the market for the firm itself, i.e., by capital\nmarkets.  Owners always have the option of selling their firm, either as a unit or piecemeal.\nOwners of manager-operated firms can and do sample the capital market from time to time.  If\nthey discover that the value of the future earnings stream to others is higher than the value of the\nfirm to them given that it is to be manager-operated, they can exercise their right to sell.  It is\nconceivable that other owners could be more efficient at monitoring or even that a single individual\nwith appropriate managerial talents and with sufficiently large personal wealth would elect to buy\nthe firm.  In this latter case the purchase by such a single individual would completely eliminate\nthe agency costs.  If there were a number of such potential owner-manager purchasers (all with\ntalents and tastes identical to the current manager) the owners would receive in the sale price of\nthe firm the full value of the residual claimant rights including the capital value of the eliminated\nagency costs plus the value of the managerial rights.\nMonopoly, competition and managerial behavior.  It is frequently argued that the\nexistence of competition in product (and factor) markets will constrain the behavior of managers\nto idealized value maximization, i.e., that monopoly in product (or monopsony in factor) markets\nJensen and Meckling\n34\n1976\nwill permit larger divergences from value maximization.30  Our analysis does not support this\nhypothesis. The owners of a firm with monopoly power have the same incentives to limit\ndivergences of the manager from value maximization (i.e., the ability to increase their wealth) as\ndo the owners of competitive firms.  Furthermore, competition in the market for managers will\ngenerally make it unnecessary for the owners to share rents with the manager.  The owners of a\nmonopoly firm need only pay the supply price for a manager.\nSince the owner of a monopoly has the same wealth incentives to minimize managerial\ncosts as would the owner of a competitive firm, both will undertake that level of monitoring which\nequates the marginal cost of monitoring to the marginal wealth increment from reduced\nconsumption of perquisites by the manager.  Thus, the existence of monopoly will not increase\nagency costs.\nFurthermore the existence of competition in product and factor markets will not eliminate\nthe agency costs due to managerial control problems as has often been asserted (cf. Friedman,\n1970).  If my competitors all incur agency costs equal to or greater than mine I will not be\neliminated from the market by their competition.\nThe existence and size of the agency costs depends on the nature of the monitoring costs,\nthe tastes of managers for non-pecuniary benefits and the supply of potential managers who are\ncapable of financing the entire venture out of their personal wealth.  If monitoring costs are zero,\n30 Where competitors are numerous and entry is easy, persistent departures from profit maximizing behavior\ninexorably leads to extinction.  Economic natural selection holds the stage.  In these circumstances, the\nbehavior of the individual units that constitute the supply side of the product market is essentially routine\nand uninteresting and economists can confidently predict industry behavior without being explicitly\nconcerned with the behavior of these individual units.\nWhen the conditions of competition are relaxed, however, the opportunity set of the firm is expanded.  In\nthis case, the behavior of the firm as a distinct operating unit is of separate interest.  Both for purposes of\ninterpreting particular behavior within the firm as well as for predicting responses of the industry aggregate,\nit may be necessary to identify the factors that influence the firm’s choices within this expanded opportunity\nset and embed these in a formal model (Williamson, 1964, p. 2).\nJensen and Meckling\n35\n1976\nagency costs will be zero or if there are enough 100 percent owner-managers available to own\nand run all the firms in an industry (competitive or not) then agency costs in that industry will also\nbe zero.31\n3.\nSome unanswered questions regarding the existence of the corporate form\n3.1  The question\nThe analysis to this point has left us with a basic puzzle:  Why, given the existence of\npositive costs of the agency relationship, do we find the usual corporate form of organization with\nwidely diffuse ownership so widely prevalent?  If one takes seriously much of the literature\nregarding the “discretionary” power held by managers of large corporations, it is difficult to\nunderstand the historical fact of enormous growth in equity in such organizations, not only in the\nUnited States, but throughout the world.  Paraphrasing Alchian (1968):  How does it happen that\nmillions of individuals are willing to turn over a significant fraction of their wealth to organizations\nrun by managers who have so little interest in their welfare?  What is even more remarkable, why\nare they willing to make these commitments purely as residual claimants, i.e., on the anticipation\nthat managers will operate the firm so that there will be earnings which accrue to the\nstockholders?\nThere is certainly no lack of alternative ways that individuals might invest, including\nentirely different forms of organizations.  Even if consideration is limited to corporate\norganizations, there are clearly alternative ways capital might be raised, i.e., through fixed claims\nof various sorts, bonds, notes, mortgages, etc.  Moreover, the corporate income tax seems to favor\nthe use of fixed claims since interest is treated as a tax deductible expense.  Those who assert\n31 Assuming there are no special tax benefits to ownership nor utility of ownership other than that derived\nfrom the direct wealth effects of ownership such as might be true for professional sports teams, race horse\nstables, firms which carry the family name, etc.\nJensen and Meckling\n36\n1976\nthat managers do not behave in the interest of stockholders have generally not addressed a very\nimportant question:  Why, if non-manager-owned shares have such a serious deficiency, have they\nnot long since been driven out by fixed claims?32\n3.2 Some alternative explanations of the ownership structure of the firm\nThe role of limited liability.  Manne (1967) and Alchian and Demsetz (1972) argue that\none of the attractive features of the corporate form vis-à-vis individual proprietorships or\npartnerships is the limited liability feature of equity claims in corporations.  Without this provision\neach and every investor purchasing one or more shares of a corporation would be potentially liable\nto the full extent of his personal wealth for the debts of the corporation.  Few individuals would\nfind this a desirable risk to accept and the major benefits to be obtained from risk reduction\nthrough diversification would be to a large extent unobtainable.  This argument, however, is\nincomplete since limited liability does not eliminate the basic risk, it merely shifts it.  The argument\nmust rest ultimately on transaction costs.  If all stockholders of GM were liable for GM’s debts,\nthe maximum liability for an individual shareholder would be greater than it would be if his shares\nhad limited liability.  However, given that many other stockholders also existed and that each was\nliable for the unpaid claims in proportion to his ownership it is highly unlikely that the maximum\npayment each would have to make would be large in the event of GM’s bankruptcy since the total\nwealth of those stockholders would also be large.  However, the existence of unlimited liability\nwould impose incentives for each shareholder to keep track of both the liabilities of GM and the\nwealth of the other GM owners.  It is easily conceivable that the costs of so doing would, in the\naggregate, be much higher than simply paying a premium in the form of higher interest rates to the\ncreditors of GM in return for their acceptance of a contract which grants limited liability to the\n32 Marris (1964, pp. 7-9) is the exception, although he argues that there exists some ‘maximum leverage point’\nJensen and Meckling\n37\n1976\nshareholders.  The creditors would then bear the risk of any non-payment of debts in the event of\nGM’s bankruptcy.\nIt is also not generally recognized that limited liability is merely a necessary condition for\nexplaining the magnitude of the reliance on equities, not a sufficient condition.  Ordinary debt also\ncarries limited liability.33  If limited liability is all that is required, why don’t we observe large\ncorporations, individually owned, with a tiny fraction of the capital supplied by the entrepreneur,\nand the rest simply borrowed.34  At first this question seems silly to many people (as does the\nquestion regarding why firms would ever issue debt or preferred stock under conditions where\nthere are no tax benefits obtained from the treatment of interest or preferred dividend\npayments.35)  We have found that oftentimes this question is misinterpreted to be one regarding\nwhy firms obtain capital.  The issue is not why they obtain capital, but why they obtain it through\nbeyond which the chances of “insolvency” are in some undefined sense too high.\n33 By limited liability we mean the same conditions that apply to common stock.  Subordinated debt or\npreferred stock could be constructed which carried with it liability provisions; i.e., if the corporation’s assets\nwere insufficient at some point to pay off all prior claims (such as trade credit, accrued wages, senior debt,\netc.) and if the personal resources of the ‘equity’ holders were also insufficient to cover these claims the\nholders of this ‘debt’ would be subject to assessments beyond the face value of their claim (assessments\nwhich might be limited or unlimited in amount).\n34 Alchian-Demsetz (1972, p. 709) argue that one can explain the existence of both bonds and stock in the\nownership structure of firms as the result of differing expectations regarding the outcomes to the firm.  They\nargue that bonds are created and sold to ‘pessimists’ and stocks with a residual claim with no upper bound\nare sold to ‘optimists.’\nAs long as capital markets are perfect with no taxes or transactions costs and individual investors can\nissue claims on distributions of outcomes on the same terms as firms, such actions on the part of firms\ncannot affect their values. The reason is simple.  Suppose such ‘pessimists’ did exist and yet the firm issues\nonly equity claims.  The demand for those equity claims would reflect the fact that the individual purchaser\ncould on his own account issue ‘bonds’ with a limited and prior claim on the distribution of outcomes on the\nequity which is exactly the same as that which the firm could issue.  Similarly, investors could easily unlever\nany position by simply buying a proportional claim on both the bonds and stocks of a levered firm.\nTherefore, a levered firm could not sell at a different price than an unlevered firm solely because of the\nexistence of such differential expectations. See Fama and Miller (1972, ch. 4) for an excellent exposition of\nthese issues.\n35 Corporations did use both prior to the institution of the corporate income tax in the United States and\npreferred dividends have, with minor exceptions, never been tax deductible.\nJensen and Meckling\n38\n1976\nthe particular forms we have observed for such long periods of time.  The fact is that no well\narticulated answer to this question currently exists in the literature of either finance or economics.\nThe “irrelevance” of capital structure.  In their pathbreaking article on the cost of\ncapital, Modigliani and Miller (1958) demonstrated that in the absence of bankruptcy costs and tax\nsubsidies on the payment of interest the value of the firm is independent of the financial structure.\nThey later (1963) demonstrated that the existence of tax subsidies on interest payments would\ncause the value of the firm to rise with the amount of debt financing by the amount of the\ncapitalized value of the tax subsidy. But this line of argument implies that the firm should be\nfinanced almost entirely with debt.  Realizing the inconsistence with observed behavior, Modigliani\nand Miller (1963, p. 442) comment:\nIt may be useful to remind readers once again that the existence of a tax advantage for\ndebt financing . . . does not necessarily mean that corporations should at all times seek to use the\nmaximum amount of debt in their capital structures . . . there are as we pointed out, limitations\nimposed by lenders . . . as well as many other dimensions (and kinds of costs) in real-world\nproblems of financial strategy which are not fully comprehended within the framework of static\nequilibrium models, either our own or those of the traditional variety.  These additional\nconsiderations, which are typically grouped under the rubric of “the need for preserving\nflexibility”, will normally imply the maintenance by the corporation of a substantial reserve of\nuntapped borrowing power.\nModigliani and Miller are essentially left without a theory of the determination of the\noptimal capital structure, and Fama and Miller (1972, p. 173) commenting on the same issue\nreiterate this conclusion:\nJensen and Meckling\n39\n1976\nAnd we must admit that at this point there is little in the way of convincing research,\neither theoretical or empirical, that explains the amounts of debt that firms do decide to have in\ntheir capital structure.\nThe Modigliani-Miller theorem is based on the assumption that the probability distribution\nof the cash flows to the firm is independent of the capital structure.  It is now recognized that the\nexistence of positive costs associated with bankruptcy and the presence of tax subsidies on\ncorporate interest payments will invalidate this irrelevance theorem precisely because the\nprobability distribution of future cash flows changes as the probability of the incurrence of the\nbankruptcy costs changes, i.e., as the ratio of debt to equity rises. We believe the existence of\nagency costs provide stronger reasons for arguing that the probability distribution of future cash\nflows is not independent of the capital or ownership structure.\nWhile the introduction of bankruptcy costs in the presence of tax subsidies leads to a\ntheory which defines an optimal capital structure,36 we argue that this theory is seriously\nincomplete since it implies that no debt should ever be used in the absence of tax subsidies if\nbankruptcy costs are positive.  Since we know debt was commonly used prior to the existence of\nthe current tax subsidies on interest payments this theory does not capture what must be some\nimportant determinants of the corporate capital structure.\nIn addition, neither bankruptcy costs nor the existence of tax subsidies can explain the use\nof preferred stock or warrants which have no tax advantages, and there is no theory which tells us\nanything about what determines the fraction of equity claims held by insiders as opposed to\noutsiders which our analysis in section 2 indicates is so important.  We return to these issues later\nafter analyzing in detail the factors affecting the agency costs associated with debt.\n36 See Kraus and Litzenberger (1973) and Lloyd-Davies (1975).\nJensen and Meckling\n40\n1976\n4.    The Agency Costs of Debt\nIn general if the agency costs engendered by the existence of outside owners are positive\nit will pay the absentee owner (i.e., shareholders) to sell out to an owner-manager who can avoid\nthese costs.37  This could be accomplished in principle by having the manager become the sole\nequity holder by repurchasing all of the outside equity claims with funds obtained through the\nissuance of limited liability debt claims and the use of his own personal wealth.  This single-owner\ncorporation would not suffer the agency costs associated with outside equity.  Therefore there\nmust be some compelling reasons why we find the diffuse-owner corporate firm financed by\nequity claims so prevalent as an organizational form.\nAn ingenious entrepreneur eager to expand, has open to him the opportunity to design a\nwhole hierarchy of fixed claims on assets and earnings, with premiums paid for different levels of\nrisk.38  Why don’t we observe large corporations individually owned with a tiny fraction of the\ncapital supplied by the entrepreneur in return for 100 percent of the equity and the rest simply\nborrowed?  We believe there are a number of reasons:  (1) the incentive effects associated with\nhighly leveraged firms, (2) the monitoring costs these incentive effects engender, and (3)\nbankruptcy costs.  Furthermore, all of these costs are simply particular aspects of the agency\ncosts associated with the existence of debt claims on the firm.\n37 And if there is competitive bidding for the firm from potential owner-managers the absentee owner will\ncapture the capitalized value of these agency costs.\n38 The spectrum of claims which firms can issue is far more diverse than is suggested by our two-way\nclassification—fixed vs. residual.  There are convertible bonds, equipment trust certificates, debentures,\nrevenue bonds, warrants, etc.  Different bond issues can contain different subordination provisions with\nrespect to assets and interest. They can be callable or non-callable.  Preferred stocks can be ‘preferred’ in a\nvariety of dimensions and contain a variety of subordination stipulations.  In the abstract, we can imagine\nfirms issuing claims contingent on a literally infinite variety of states of the world such as those considered\nin the literature on the time-state-preference models of Arrow (1964b), Debreu (1959) and Hirshleifer (1970).\nJensen and Meckling\n41\n1976\n4.1  The Incentive Effects Associated with Debt\nWe don’t find many large firms financed almost entirely with debt-type claims (i.e., non-\nresidual claims) because of the effect such a financial structure would have on the owner-\nmanager’s behavior.  Potential creditors will not loan $100,000,000 to a firm in which the\nentrepreneur has an investment of $10,000.  With that financial structure the owner-manager will\nhave a strong incentive to engage in activities (investments) which promise very high payoffs if\nsuccessful even if they have a very low probability of success.  If they turn out well, he captures\nmost of the gains, if they turn out badly, the creditors bear most of the costs.39\nTo illustrate the incentive effects associated with the existence of debt and to provide a\nframework within which we can discuss the effects of monitoring and bonding costs, wealth\ntransfers, and the incidence of agency costs, we again consider a simple situation.  Assume we\nhave a manager-owned firm with no debt outstanding in a world in which there are no taxes.  The\nfirm has the opportunity to take one of two mutually exclusive equal cost investment opportunities,\neach of which yields a random payoff, X j ,T  periods in the future (j = 1,2).  Production and\nmonitoring activities take place continuously between time 0 and time T, and markets in which the\nclaims on the firm can be traded are open continuously over this period.  After time T the firm has\nno productive activities so the payoff X j  includes the distribution of all remaining assets.  For\nsimplicity, we assume that the two distributions are log-normally distributed and have the same\nexpected total payoff, E(X ), where X  is defined as the logarithm of the final payoff.  The\ndistributions differ only by their variances with\n1\n2\nσ <\n2\n2\nσ .  The systematic or covariance risk of\neach of the distributions, βj, in the Sharpe (1964)-Lintner (1965) capital asset pricing model, is\n39 An apt analogy is the way one would play poker on money borrowed at a fixed interest rate, with one’s\nown liability limited to some very small stake.  Fama and Miller (1972, pp. 179-180) also discuss and provide a\nnumerical example of an investment decision which illustrates very nicely the potential inconsistency\nbetween the interests of bondholders and stockholders.\nJensen and Meckling\n42\n1976\nassumed to be identical.  Assuming that asset prices are determined according to the capital asset\npricing model, the preceding assumptions imply that the total market value of each of these\ndistributions is identical, and we represent this value by V.\nIf the owner-manager has the right to decide which investment program to take, and if\nafter he decides this he has the opportunity to sell part or all of his claims on the outcomes in the\nform of either debt or equity, he will be indifferent between the two investments.40\nHowever, if the owner has the opportunity to first issue debt, then to decide which of the\ninvestments to take, and then to sell all or part of his remaining equity claim on the market, he will\nnot be indifferent between the two investments. The reason is that by promising to take the low\nvariance project, selling bonds and then taking the high variance project he can transfer wealth\nfrom the (naive) bondholders to himself as equity holder.\nLet X* be the amount of the “fixed” claim in the form of a non-coupon bearing bond sold\nto the bondholders such that the total payoff to them Rj(j = 1, 2, denotes the distribution the\nmanager chooses), is\njR  =  X*,  if   X j  ≥ X*,\n      =\nj\nX ,  if\nj\nX  ≤ X *.\nLet B1 be the current market value of bondholder claims if investment 1 is taken, and let\nB2 be the current market value of bondholders claims if investment 2 is taken.  Since in this\nexample the total value of the firm, V, is independent of the investment choice and also of the\nfinancing decision we can use the Black-Scholes (1973) option pricing model to determine the\n40 The portfolio diversification issues facing the owner-manager are brought into the analysis in section 5\nbelow.\nJensen and Meckling\n43\n1976\nvalues of the debt, Bj, and equity, Sj, under each of the choices.41  Black-Scholes derive the\nsolution for the value of a European call option (one which can be exercised only at the maturity\ndate) and argue that the resulting option pricing equation can be used to determine the value of the\nequity claim on a leveraged firm.  That is the stockholders in such a firm can be viewed as holding\na European call option on the total value of the firm with exercise price equal to X* (the face\nvalue of the debt), exercisable at the maturity date of the debt issue.  More simply, the\nstockholders have the right to buy the firm back from the bondholders for a price of X* at time T.\nMerton (1973, 1974) shows that as the variance of the outcome distribution rises the value of the\nstock (i.e., call option) rises, and since our two distributions differ only in their variances,\n2\n2\nσ >\n1\n2\nσ ,\nthe equity value S1 is less than S2.  This implies B1 > B2, since B1 = V-S1, and B2 = V-S2.\nNow if the owner-manager could sell bonds with face value X* under the conditions that\nthe potential bondholders believed this to be a claim on distribution 1, he would receive a price of\nB1.  After selling the bonds, his equity interest in distribution 1 would have value S1.  But we know\nS2 is greater than S1 and thus the manager can make himself better off by changing the investment\nto take the higher variance distribution 2, thereby redistributing wealth from the bondholders to\nhimself.  All this assumes of course that the bondholders could not prevent him from changing the\ninvestment program.  If the bondholders cannot do so, and if they perceive that the manager\nhas the opportunity to take distribution 2 they will pay the manager only B2 for the claim\nX*, realizing that his maximizing behavior will lead him to choose distribution 2.  In this\nevent there is no redistribution of wealth between bondholders and stockholders (and in general\nwith rational expectations there never will be) and no welfare loss.  It is easy to construct a case,\nhowever, in which these incentive effects do generate real costs.\n41 See Smith (1976) for a review of this option pricing literature and its applications and Galai and Masulis\n(1976) who apply the option pricing model to mergers, and corporate investment decisions.\nJensen and Meckling\n44\n1976\nLet cash flow distribution 2 in the previous example have an expected value, E(X2), which\nis lower than that of distribution 1.  Then we know that V1 > V2, and if \u001fV, which is given by\n\u001fV = V1-V2 = (S1-S2) + (B1-B2),\nis sufficiently small relative to the reduction in the value of the bonds the value of the stock will\nincrease.42  Rearranging the expression for \u001fV we see that the difference between the equity\nvalues for the two investments is given by\nS2-S1 = (B1-B2) - (V1-V2),\nand the first term on the RHS, (B1-B2), is the amount of wealth “transferred” from the\nbondholders and V1-V2 is the reduction in overall firm value.  Since we know B1 > B2), S2-S1  can\nbe positive even though the reduction in the value of the firm, V1-V2, is positive.43  Again, the\nbondholders will not actually lose as long as they accurately perceive the motivation of the equity\nowning manager and his opportunity to take project 2.  They will presume he will take investment\n2, and hence will pay no more than B2 for the bonds when they are issued.\n42 While we used the option pricing model above to motivate the discussion and provide some intuitive\nunderstanding of the incentives facing the equity holders, the option pricing solutions of Black and Scholes\n(1973) do not apply when incentive effects cause V to be a function of the debt/equity ratio as it is in general\nand in this example.  Long (1974) points out this difficulty with respect to the usefulness of the model in the\ncontext of tax subsidies on interest and bankruptcy cost. The results of Merton (1974) and Galai and\nMasulis (1976) must be interpreted with care since the solutions are strictly incorrect in the context of tax\nsubsidies and/or agency costs.\n43 The numerical example of Fama and Miller (1972, pp. 179-180) is a close representation of this case in a\ntwo-period state model. However, they go on to make the following statement on p. 180:\nFrom a practical viewpoint, however, situations of potential conflict between bondholders and\nshareholders in the application of the market value rule are probably unimportant.  In general, investment\nopportunities that increase a firm’s market value by more than their cost both increase the value of the firm’s\nshares and strengthen the firm’s future ability to meet its current bond commitments.\nThis first issue regarding the importance of the conflict of interest between bondholders and stockholders\nis an empirical one, and the last statement is incomplete—in some circumstances the equity holders could\nbenefit from projects whose net effect was to reduce the total value of the firm as they and we have\nillustrated.  The issue cannot be brushed aside so easily.\nJensen and Meckling\n45\n1976\nIn this simple example the reduced value of the firm, V1-V2, is the agency cost engendered\nby the issuance of debt44 and it is borne by the owner-manager.  If he could finance the project\nout of his personal wealth, he would clearly choose project 1 since its investment outlay was\nassumed equal to that of project 2 and its market value, V1, was greater.  This wealth loss, V1-V2,\nis the “residual loss” portion of what we have defined as agency costs and it is generated by the\ncooperation required to raise the funds to make the investment.  Another important part of the\nagency costs are monitoring and bonding costs and we now consider their role.\n4.2 The Role of Monitoring and Bonding Costs\nIn principle it would be possible for the bondholders, by the inclusion of various covenants\nin the indenture provisions, to limit the managerial behavior which results in reductions in the value\nof the bonds.  Provisions which impose constraints on management’s decisions regarding such\nthings as dividends, future debt issues,45 and maintenance of working capital are not uncommon in\nbond issues.46  To completely protect the bondholders from the incentive effects, these provisions\nwould have to be incredibly detailed and cover most operating aspects of the enterprise including\nlimitations on the riskiness of the projects undertaken.  The costs involved in writing such\nprovisions, the costs of enforcing them and the reduced profitability of the firm (induced because\nthe covenants occasionally limit management’s ability to take optimal actions on certain issues)\n44 Myers (1975) points out another serious incentive effect on managerial decisions of the existence of debt\nwhich does not occur in our simple single decision world.  He shows that if the firm has the option to take\nfuture investment opportunities the existence of debt which matures after the options must be taken will\ncause the firm (using an equity value maximizing investment rule) to refuse to take some otherwise profitable\nprojects because they would benefit only the bondholders and not the equity holders.  This will (in the\nabsence of tax subsidies to debt) cause the value of the firm to fall.  Thus (although he doesn’t use the term)\nthese incentive effects also contribute to the agency costs of debt in a manner perfectly consistent with the\nexamples discussed in the text.\n45 Black-Scholes (1973) discuss ways in which dividend and future financing policy can redistribute wealth\nbetween classes of claimants on the firm.\nJensen and Meckling\n46\n1976\nwould likely be non-trivial.  In fact, since management is a continuous decision-making process it\nwill be almost impossible to completely specify such conditions without having the bondholders\nactually perform the management function. All costs associated with such covenants are what we\nmean by monitoring costs.\nThe bondholders will have incentives to engage in the writing of such covenants and in\nmonitoring the actions of the manager to the point where the “nominal” marginal cost to them of\nsuch activities is just equal to the marginal benefits they perceive from engaging in them. We use\nthe word nominal here because debtholders will not in fact bear these costs. As long as they\nrecognize their existence, they will take them into account in deciding the price they will pay for\nany given debt claim,47 and therefore the seller of the claim (the owner) will bear the costs just as\nin the equity case discussed in section 2.\nIn addition the manager has incentives to take into account the costs imposed on the firm\nby covenants in the debt agreement which directly affect the future cash flows of the firm since\nthey reduce the market value of his claims.  Because both the external and internal monitoring\ncosts are imposed on the owner-manager it is in his interest to see that the monitoring is\nperformed in the lowest cost way.  Suppose, for example, that the bondholders (or outside equity\nholders) would find it worthwhile to produce detailed financial statements such as those contained\nin the usual published accounting reports as a means of monitoring the manager.  If the manager\nhimself can produce such information at lower costs than they (perhaps because he is already\ncollecting much of the data they desire for his own internal decision-making purposes), it would\n46 Black, Miller and Posner (1978) discuss many of these issues with particular reference to the government\nregulation of bank holding companies.\n47 In other words, these costs will be taken into account in determining the yield to maturity on the issue.\nFor an examination of the effects of such enforcement costs on the nominal interest rates in the consumer\nsmall loan market, see Benston (1977).\nJensen and Meckling\n47\n1976\npay him to agree in advance to incur the cost of providing such reports and to have their accuracy\ntestified to by an independent outside auditor.  This is an example of what we refer to as bonding\ncosts.48,49\n48 To illustrate the fact that it will sometimes pay the manager to incur ‘bonding’ costs to guarantee the\nbondholders that he will not deviate from his promised behavior let us suppose that for an expenditure of $b\nof the firm’s resources he can guarantee that project 1 will be chosen.  If he spends these resources and\ntakes project 1 the value of the firm will be V1-b and clearly as long as (V1-b) > V2, or alternatively (V1-V2) > b\nhe will be better off, since his wealth will be equal to the value of the firm minus the required investment, I\n(which we assumed for simplicity to be identical for the two projects).\nOn the other hand, to prove that the owner-manager prefers the lowest cost solution to the conflict let us\nassume he can write a covenant into the bond issue which will allow the bondholders to prevent him from\ntaking project 2, if they incur monitoring costs of $m, where m < b.  If he does this his wealth will be higher\nby the amount b-m.  To see this note that if the bond market is competitive and makes unbiased estimates,\npotential bondholders will be indifferent between:\n  (i)\na claim X* with no covenant (and no guarantees from management) at a price of B2,\n (ii)\na claim X* with no covenant (and guarantees from management, through bonding expenditures\nby the firm of $b, that project 1 will be taken) at a price of B1, and\n(iii)\na claim X* with a covenant and the opportunity to spend m on monitoring (to guarantee\nproject 1 will be taken) at a price of B1-m.\nThe bondholders will realize that (i) represents in fact a claim on project 2 and that (ii) and (iii) represent a\nclaim on project 1 and are thus indifferent between the three options at the specified prices.  The owner-\nmanager, however, will not be indifferent between incurring the bonding costs, b, directly, or including the\ncovenant in the bond indenture and letting the bondholders spend m to guarantee that he take project 1.\nHis wealth in the two cases will be given by the value of his equity plus the proceeds of the bond issue less\nthe required investment, and if m < b < V1-V2, then his post-investment-financing wealth, W, for the three\noptions will be such that Wi < Wii < Wiii.  Therefore, since it would increase his wealth, he would voluntarily\ninclude the covenant in the bond issue and let the bondholders monitor.\n49 We mention, without going into the problem in detail, that similar to the case in which the outside equity\nholders are allowed to monitor the manager-owner, the agency relationship between the bondholders and\nstockholders has a symmetry if the rights of the bondholders to limit actions of the manager are not\nperfectly spelled out.  Suppose the bondholders, by spending sufficiently large amounts of resources, could\nforce management to take actions which would transfer wealth from the equity holder to the bondholders\n(by taking sufficiently less risky projects).  One can easily construct situations where such actions could\nmake the bondholders better off, hurt the equity holders and actually lower the total value of the firm.  Given\nthe nature of the debt contract the original owner-manager might maximize his wealth in such a situation by\nselling off the equity and keeping the bonds as his ‘owner’s’ interest.  If the nature of the bond contract is\ngiven, this may well be an inefficient solution since the total agency costs (i.e., the sum of monitoring and\nvalue loss) could easily be higher than the alternative solution.  However, if the owner-manager could\nstrictly limit the rights of the bondholders (perhaps by inclusion of a provision which expressly reserves all\nrights not specifically granted to the bondholder for the equity holder), he would find it in his interest to\nestablish the efficient contractual arrangement since by minimizing the agency costs he would be maximizing\nhis wealth.  These issues involve the fundamental nature of contracts and for now we simply assume that\nthe ‘bondholders’ rights are strictly limited and unambiguous and all rights not specifically granted them are\nreserved for the ‘stockholders’; a situation descriptive of actual institutional arrangements.  This allows us\nto avoid the incentive effects associated with “bondholders” potentially exploiting ‘stockholders.’\nJensen and Meckling\n48\n1976\n4.3 Bankruptcy and Reorganization Costs\nWe argue in section 5 that as the debt in the capital structure increases beyond some point\nthe marginal agency costs of debt begin to dominate the marginal agency costs of outside equity\nand the result of this is the generally observed phenomenon of the simultaneous use of both debt\nand outside equity.  Before considering these issues, however, we consider here the third major\ncomponent of the agency costs of debt which helps to explain why debt doesn’t completely\ndominate capital structures—the existence of bankruptcy and reorganization costs.\nIt is important to emphasize that bankruptcy and liquidation are very different events.  The\nlegal definition of bankruptcy is difficult to specify precisely.  In general, it occurs when the firm\ncannot meet a current payment on a debt obligation,50 or one or more of the other indenture\nprovisions providing for bankruptcy is violated by the firm. In this event the stockholders have lost\nall claims on the firm,51 and the remaining loss, the difference between the face value of the fixed\nclaims and the market value of the firm, is borne by the debtholders.  Liquidation of the firm’s\nassets will occur only if the market value of the future cash flows generated by the firm is less\nthan the opportunity cost of the assets, i.e., the sum of the values which could be realized if the\nassets were sold piecemeal.\nIf there were no costs associated with the event called bankruptcy the total market value\nof the firm would not be affected by increasing the probability of its incurrence.  However, it is\ncostly, if not impossible, to write contracts representing claims on a firm which clearly delineate\nthe rights of holders for all possible contingencies.  Thus even if there were no adverse incentive\n50 If the firm were allowed to sell assets to meet a current debt obligation, bankruptcy would occur when the\ntotal market value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the firm is less than the value of a\ncurrent payment on a debt obligation.  Many bond indentures do not, however, allow for the sale of assets\nto meet debt obligations.\nJensen and Meckling\n49\n1976\neffects in expanding fixed claims relative to equity in a firm, the use of such fixed claims would be\nconstrained by the costs inherent in defining and enforcing those claims.  Firms incur obligations\ndaily to suppliers, to employees, to different classes of investors, etc.  So long as the firm is\nprospering, the adjudication of claims is seldom a problem.  When the firm has difficulty meeting\nsome of its obligations, however, the issue of the priority of those claims can pose serious\nproblems. This is most obvious in the extreme case where the firm is forced into bankruptcy.  If\nbankruptcy were costless, the reorganization would be accompanied by an adjustment of the\nclaims of various parties and the business, could, if that proved to be in the interest of the\nclaimants, simply go on (although perhaps under new management).52\nIn practice, bankruptcy is not costless, but generally involves an adjudication process\nwhich itself consumes a fraction of the remaining value of the assets of the firm.  Thus the cost of\nbankruptcy will be of concern to potential buyers of fixed claims in the firm since their existence\nwill reduce the payoffs to them in the event of bankruptcy.  These are examples of the agency\ncosts of cooperative efforts among individuals (although in this case perhaps “non-cooperative”\nwould be a better term). The price buyers will be willing to pay for fixed claims will thus be\ninversely related to the probability of the incurrence of these costs i.e., to the probability of\nbankruptcy.  Using a variant of the argument employed above for monitoring costs, it can be\nshown that the total value of the firm will fall, and the owner-manager equity holder will bear the\n51 We have been told that while this is true in principle, the actual behavior of the courts appears to\nfrequently involve the provision of some settlement to the common stockholders even when the assets of\nthe company are not sufficient to cover the claims of the creditors.\n52 If under bankruptcy the bondholders have the right to fire the management, the management will have\nsome incentives to avoid taking actions which increase the probability of this event (even if it is in the best\ninterest of the equity holders) if they (the management) are earning rents or if they have human capital\nspecialized to this firm or if they face large adjustment costs in finding new employment.  A detailed\nexamination of this issue involves the value of the control rights (the rights to hire and fire the manager) and\nwe leave it to a subsequent paper.\nJensen and Meckling\n50\n1976\nentire wealth effect of the bankruptcy costs as long as potential bondholders make unbiased\nestimates of their magnitude at the time they initially purchase bonds.53\nEmpirical studies of the magnitude of bankruptcy costs are almost non-existent.  Warner\n(1977) in a study of 11 railroad bankruptcies between 1930 and 1955 estimates the average costs\nof bankruptcy54 as a fraction of the value of the firm three years prior to bankruptcy to be 2.5%\n(with a range of 0.4% to 5.9%).  The average dollar costs were $1.88 million.  Both of these\nmeasures seem remarkably small and are consistent with our belief that bankruptcy costs\nthemselves are unlikely to be the major determinant of corporate capital structures.  it is also\ninteresting to note that the annual amount of defaulted funds has fallen significantly since 1940.\n(See Atkinson, 1967.)  One possible explanation for this phenomena is that firms are using\nmergers to avoid the costs of bankruptcy.  This hypothesis seems even more reasonable, if, as is\nfrequently the case, reorganization costs represent only a fraction of the costs associated with\nbankruptcy.\nIn general the revenues or the operating costs of the firm are not independent of the\nprobability of bankruptcy and thus the capital structure of the firm.  As the probability of\nbankruptcy increases, both the operating costs and the revenues of the firm are adversely\naffected, and some of these costs can be avoided by merger.  For example, a firm with a high\nprobability of bankruptcy will also find that it must pay higher salaries to induce executives to\naccept the higher risk of unemployment.  Furthermore, in certain kinds of durable goods industries\nthe demand function for the firm’s product will not be independent of the probability of\nbankruptcy.  The computer industry is a good example. There, the buyer’s welfare is dependent to\n53 Kraus and Litzenberger (1973) and Lloyd-Davies (1975) demonstrate that the total value of the firm will be\nreduced by these costs.\nJensen and Meckling\n51\n1976\na significant extent on the ability to maintain the equipment, and on continuous hardware and\nsoftware development.  Furthermore, the owner of a large computer often receives benefits from\nthe software developments of other users.  Thus if the manufacturer leaves the business or loses\nhis software support and development experts because of financial difficulties, the value of the\nequipment to his users will decline. The buyers of such services have a continuing interest in the\nmanufacturer’s viability not unlike that of a bondholder, except that their benefits come in the form\nof continuing services at lower cost rather than principle and interest payments. Service facilities\nand spare parts for automobiles and machinery are other examples.\nIn summary then the agency costs associated with debt55 consist of:\n1. the opportunity wealth loss caused by the impact of debt on the investment decisions\nof the firm,\n2. the monitoring and bonding expenditures by the bondholders and the owner-manager\n(i.e., the firm),\n3. the bankruptcy and reorganization costs.\n4.4 Why Are the Agency Costs of Debt Incurred?\nWe have argued that the owner-manager bears the entire wealth effects of the agency\ncosts of debt and he captures the gains from reducing them.  Thus, the agency costs associated\nwith debt discussed above will tend, in the absence of other mitigating factors, to discourage the\nuse of corporate debt.  What are the factors that encourage its use?\nOne factor is the tax subsidy on interest payments.  (This will not explain preferred stock\nwhere dividends are not tax deductible.)56  Modigliani and Miller (1963) originally demonstrated\n54 These include only payments to all parties for legal fees, professional services, trustees’ fees and filing\nfees.  They do not include the costs of management time or changes in cash flows due to shifts in the firm’s\ndemand or cost functions discussed below.\nJensen and Meckling\n52\n1976\nthat the use of riskless perpetual debt will increase the total value of the firm (ignoring the agency\ncosts) by an amount equal to τB, where τ is the marginal and average corporate tax rate and B is\nthe market value of the debt.  Fama and Miller (1972, ch. 4) demonstrate that for the case of risky\ndebt the value of the firm will increase by the market value of the (uncertain) tax subsidy on the\ninterest payments.  Again, these gains will accrue entirely to the equity and will provide an\nincentive to utilize debt to the point where the marginal wealth benefits of the tax subsidy are just\nequal to the marginal wealth effects of the agency costs discussed above.\nHowever, even in the absence of these tax benefits, debt would be utilized if the ability to\nexploit potentially profitable investment opportunities is limited by the resources of the owner.  If\nthe owner of a project cannot raise capital he will suffer an opportunity loss represented by the\nincrement in value offered to him by the additional investment opportunities.  Thus even though he\nwill bear the agency costs from selling debt, he will find it desirable to incur them to obtain\nadditional capital as long as the marginal wealth increments from the new investments projects are\ngreater than the marginal agency costs of debt, and these agency costs are in turn less than those\ncaused by the sale of additional equity discussed in section 2. Furthermore, this solution is optimal\nfrom the social viewpoint.  However, in the absence of tax subsidies on debt these projects must\n55 Which, incidentally, exist only when the debt has some probability of default.\n56 Our theory is capable of explaining why in the absence of the tax subsidy on interest payments, we would\nexpect to find firms using both debt and preferred stocks—a problem which has long puzzled at least one of\nthe authors.  If preferred stock has all the characteristics of debt except for the fact that its holders cannot\nput the firm into bankruptcy in the event of nonpayment of the preferred dividends, then the agency costs\nassociated with the issuance of preferred stock will be lower than those associated with debt by the present\nvalue of the bankruptcy costs.\nHowever, these lower agency costs of preferred stock exist only over some range if as the amount of such\nstock rises the incentive effects caused by their existence impose value reductions which are larger than that\ncaused by debt (including the bankruptcy costs of debt).  There are two reasons for this.  First, the equity\nholder’s claims can be eliminated by the debtholders in the event of bankruptcy, and second, the\ndebtholders have the right to fire the management in the event of bankruptcy.  Both of these will tend to\nbecome more important as an advantage to the issuance of debt as we compare situations with large\namounts of preferred stock to equivalent situations with large amounts of debt because they will tend to\nreduce the incentive effects of large amounts of preferred stock.\nJensen and Meckling\n53\n1976\nbe unique to this firm57 or they would be taken by other competitive entrepreneurs (perhaps new\nones) who possessed the requisite personal wealth to fully finance the projects58 and therefore\nable to avoid the existence of debt or outside equity.\n5.    A Theory of the Corporate Ownership Structure\nIn the previous sections we discussed the nature of agency costs associated with outside\nclaims on the firm—both debt and equity.  Our purpose here is to integrate these concepts into the\nbeginnings of a theory of the corporate ownership structure.  We use the term “ownership\nstructure” rather than “capital structure” to highlight the fact that the crucial variables to be\ndetermined are not just the relative amounts of debt and equity but also the fraction of the equity\nheld by the manager.  Thus, for a given size firm we want a theory to determine three variables:59\nSi : inside equity (held by the manager),\nSo : outside equity (held by anyone outside of the firm),\nB  : debt (held by anyone outside of the firm).\n57 One other condition also has to hold to justify the incurrence of the costs associated with the use of debt\nor outside equity in our firm.  If there are other individuals in the economy who have sufficiently large\namounts of personal capital to finance the entire firm, our capital constrained owner can realize the full\ncapital value of his current and prospective projects and avoid the agency costs by simply selling the firm\n(i.e., the right to take these projects) to one of these individuals.  He will then avoid the wealth losses\nassociated with the agency costs caused by the sale of debt or outside equity.  If no such individuals exist,\nit will pay him (and society) to obtain the additional capital in the debt market.  This implies, incidentally,\nthat it is somewhat misleading to speak of the owner-manager as the individual who bears the agency costs.\nOne could argue that it is the project which bears the costs since, if it is not sufficiently profitable to cover\nall the costs (including the agency costs), it will not be taken.  We continue to speak of the owner-manager\nbearing these costs to emphasize the more correct and important point that he has the incentive to reduce\nthem because, if he does, his wealth will be increased.\n58 We continue to ignore for the moment the additional complicating factor involved with the portfolio\ndecisions of the owner, and the implied acceptance of potentially diversifiable risk by such 100% owners in\nthis example.\n59 We continue to ignore such instruments as convertible bonds and warrants.\nJensen and Meckling\n54\n1976\nThe total market value of the equity is S = Si+So, and the total market value of the firm is\nV = S+B.  In addition, we also wish to have a theory which determines the optimal size of the\nfirm, i.e., its level of investment.\n5.1 Determination of the Optimal Ratio of Outside Equity to Debt\nConsider first the determination of the optimal ratio of outside equity to debt, So/B.  To do\nthis let us hold the size of the firm constant.  V, the actual value of the firm for a given size, will\ndepend on the agency costs incurred, hence we use as our index of size V*, the value of the firm\nat a given scale when agency costs are zero.  For the moment we also hold the amount of outside\nfinancing (B+So), constant.  Given that a specified amount of financing (B+So) is to be obtained\nexternally our problem is to determine the optimal fraction E*  ≡\no\n*\nS /(B + So) to be financed with\nequity.\nWe argued above that:  (1) as long as capital markets are efficient (i.e., characterized by\nrational expectations) the prices of assets such as debt and outside equity will reflect unbiased\nestimates of the monitoring costs and redistributions which the agency relationship will engender,\nand (2) the selling owner-manager will bear these agency costs.  Thus from the owner-manager’s\nstandpoint the optimal proportion of outside funds to be obtained from equity (versus debt) for a\ngiven level of internal equity is that E which results in minimum total agency costs.\nFig. 5 presents a breakdown of the agency costs into two separate components:  Define\nASo(E) as the total agency costs (a function of E) associated with the ‘exploitation’ of the outside\nequity holders by the owner-manager, and AB(E) as the total agency costs associated with the\npresence of debt in the ownership structure. Aτ(E) = ASo(E) + AB(E) is the total agency cost.\nJensen and Meckling\n55\n1976\nFig. 5.\nTotal agency costs, Aτ(E), as a function of the ratio of outside equity, to total outside financing, E\n≡ So/(B+So), for a given firm size V* and given total amounts of outside financing (B+So).  ASo(E) ≡ agency\ncosts associated with outside equity.  AB(E) ≡ agency costs associated with debt, B. AT(E*) = minimum total\nagency costs at optimal fraction of outside financing E*.\nConsider the function ASo(E).  When E ≡ So/(B+So) is zero, i.e., when there is no outside\nequity, the manager’s incentives to exploit the outside equity is at a minimum (zero) since the\nchanges in the value of the total equity are equal to the changes in his equity.60  As E increases to\n100 percent his incentives to exploit the outside equity holders increase and hence the agency\ncosts ASo(E) increase.\n60 Note, however, that even when outsiders own none of the equity the stockholder-manager still has some\nincentives to engage in activities which yield him non-pecuniary benefits but reduce the value of the firm by\nmore than he personally values the benefits if there is any risky debt outstanding.  Any such actions he\ntakes which reduce the value of the firm, V, tend to reduce the value of the bonds as well as the value of the\nequity.  Although the option pricing model does not in general apply exactly to the problem of valuing the\ndebt and equity of the firm, it can be useful in obtaining some qualitative insights into matters such as this.\nIn the option pricing model ∂S/∂V indicates the rate at which the stock value changes per dollar change in\nthe value of the firm (and similarly for ∂S/∂V).  Both of these terms are less than unity (cf. Black and Scholes,\n1973).  Therefore, any action of the manager which reduces the value of the firm, V, tends to reduce the\nvalue of both the stock and the bonds, and the larger is the total debt/equity ratio the smaller is the impact\nof any given change in V on the value of the equity, and therefore, the lower is the cost to him of consuming\nnon-pecuniary benefits.\nJensen and Meckling\n56\n1976\nThe agency costs associated with the existence of debt, AB(E) are composed mainly of\nthe value reductions in the firm and monitoring costs caused by the manager’s incentive to\nreallocate wealth from the bondholders to himself by increasing the value of his equity claim.\nThey are at a maximum where all outside funds are obtained from debt, i.e., where So = E = 0.\nAs the amount of debt declines to zero these costs also go to zero because as E goes to 1, his\nincentive to reallocate wealth from the bondholders to himself falls.  These incentives fall for two\nreasons:  (1) the total amount of debt falls, and therefore it is more difficult to reallocate any given\namount away from the debtholders, and (2) his share of any reallocation which is accomplished is\nfalling since So is rising and therefore Si/(So+Si), his share of the total equity, is falling.\nThe curve Aτ(E) represents the sum of the agency costs from various combinations of\noutside equity and debt financing, and as long as ASo(E) and AB(E) are as we have drawn them\nthe minimum total agency cost for given size firm and outside financing will occur at some point\nsuch as Aτ(E*) with a mixture of both debt and equity.61\nA caveat.  Before proceeding further we point out that the issue regarding the exact\nshapes of the functions drawn in fig. 5 and several others discussed below is essentially an open\nquestion at this time.  In the end the shape of these functions is a question of fact and can only be\nsettled by empirical evidence.  We outline some a priori arguments which we believe lead to some\nplausible hypotheses about the behavior of the system, but confess that we are far from\nunderstanding the many conceptual subtleties of the problem. We are fairly confident of our\narguments regarding the signs of the first derivatives of the functions, but the second derivatives\nare also important to the final solution and much more work (both theoretical and empirical) is\nrequired before we can have much confidence regarding these parameters. We anticipate the\n61 This occurs, of course, not at the intersection of ASo(E) and AB(E), but at the point where the absolute\nvalue oft he slopes of the functions are equal, i.e., where A’So(E)+A’B(E) = 0.\nJensen and Meckling\n57\n1976\nwork of others as well as our own to cast more light on these issues.  Moreover, we suspect the\nresults of such efforts will generate revisions to the details of what follows. We believe it is\nworthwhile to delineate the overall framework in order to demonstrate, if only in a simplified\nfashion, how the major pieces of the puzzle fit together into a cohesive structure.\n5.2 Effects of the Scale of Outside Financing\nIn order to investigate the effects of increasing the amount of outside financing, B+So, and\ntherefore reducing the amount of equity held by the manager, Si, we continue to hold the scale of\nthe firm, V*, constant.  Fig. 6 presents a plot of the agency cost functions ASo(E), AB(E) and Aτ(E)\n= ASo(E)+AB(E), for two different levels of outside financing.  Define an index of the amount of\noutside financing to be\nK = (B + So)/V*,\nand consider two different possible levels of outside financing Ko and K1 for a given scale of the\nfirm such that Ko < K1.\nAs the amount of outside equity increases, the owner’s fractional claim on the firm, α,\nfalls.  He will be induced thereby to take additional non-pecuniary benefits out of the firm because\nhis share of the cost falls.  This also increases the marginal benefits from monitoring activities and\ntherefore will tend to increase the optimal level of monitoring.  Both of these factors will cause the\nlocus of agency costs ASo(E;K) to shift upward as the fraction of outside financing, K, increases.\nThis is depicted in fig. 6 by the two curves representing the agency costs of equity, one for the\nlow level of outside financing, ASo(E;Ko), the other for the high level of outside financing,\nASo(E;K1).  The locus of the latter lies above the former everywhere except at the origin where\nboth are 0.\nJensen and Meckling\n58\n1976\nFig. 6.\nAgency cost functions and optimal outside equity as a fraction of total outside financing, E*(K),\nfor two different levels of outside financing.  K, for a given size firm, V* : K1 > Ko.\nThe agency cost of debt will similarly rise as the amount of outside financing increases.\nThis means that the locus of AB(E;K1) for high outside financing, K1, will lie above the locus of\nAB(E;Ko) for low outside financing, Ko because the total amount of resources which can be\nreallocated from bondholders increases as the total amount of debt increases.  However, since\nthese costs are zero when the debt is zero for both Ko and K1 the intercepts of the AB(E;K)\ncurves coincide at the right axis.\nThe net effect of the increased use of outside financing given the cost functions assumed\nin fig. 6 is to:  (1) increase the total agency costs from Aτ(E*;Ko) to Aτ(E*;K1), and (2) to\nincrease the optimal fraction of outside funds obtained from the sale of outside equity.  We draw\nthese functions for illustration only and are unwilling to speculate at this time on the exact form of\nJensen and Meckling\n59\n1976\nE*(K) which gives the general effects of increasing outside financing on the relative quantities of\ndebt and equity.\nThe locus of points Aτ(E*;K) where agency costs are minimized (not drawn in fig. 6),\ndetermines E*(K), the optimal proportions of equity and debt to be used in obtaining outside funds\nas the fraction of outside funds, K, ranges from 0 to 100 percent.  The solid line in fig. 7 is a plot\nof the minimum total agency costs as a function of the amount of outside financing for a firm with\nscale\no\n*\nV .  The dotted line shows the total agency costs for a larger firm with scale\n1\n*\nV  >\no\n*\nV .\nThat is, we hypothesize that the larger the firm becomes the larger are the total agency costs\nbecause it is likely that the monitoring function is inherently more difficult and expensive in a larger\norganization.\nFig. 7.\nTotal agency costs as a function of the fraction of the firm financed by outside claims for two firm\nsizes,\n1\n*\nV  >\no\n*\nV .\nJensen and Meckling\n60\n1976\n5.3 Risk and the Demand for Outside Financing\nThe model we have used to explain the existence of minority shareholders and debt in the\ncapital structure of corporations implies that the owner-manager, if he resorts to any outside\nfunding, will have his entire wealth invested in the firm.  The reason is that he can thereby avoid\nthe agency costs which additional outside funding impose. This suggests he would not resort to\noutside funding until he had invested 100 percent of his personal wealth in the firm—an implication\nwhich is not consistent with what we generally observe.  Most owner-managers hold personal\nwealth in a variety of forms, and some have only a relatively small fraction of their wealth\ninvested in the corporation they manage.62  Diversification on the part of owner-managers can be\nexplained by risk aversion and optimal portfolio selection.\nIf the returns from assets are not perfectly correlated an individual can reduce the\nriskiness of the returns on his portfolio by dividing his wealth among many different assets, i.e., by\ndiversifying.63   Thus a manager who invests all of his wealth in a single firm (his own) will\ngenerally bear a welfare loss (if he is risk averse) because he is bearing more risk than necessary.\nHe will, of course, be willing to pay something to avoid this risk, and the costs he must bear to\naccomplish this diversification will be the agency costs outlined above.  He will suffer a wealth\nloss as he reduces his fractional ownership because prospective shareholders and bondholders will\ntake into account the agency costs. Nevertheless, the manager’s desire to avoid risk will\ncontribute to his becoming a minority stockholder.\n62 On the average, however, top managers seem to have substantial holdings in absolute dollars.  A recent\nsurvey by Wytmar (1974, p. 1) reported that the median value of 826 chief executive officers’ stock holdings\nin their companies at year end 1973 and $557,000 and $1.3 million at year end 1972.\n63 These diversification effects can be substantial.  Evans and Archer (1968) show that on the average for\nNew York Stock Exchange securities approximately 55% of the total risk (as measured by standard deviation\nof portfolio returns) can be eliminated by following a naive strategy of dividing one’s assets equally among\n40 randomly selected securities.\nJensen and Meckling\n61\n1976\n5.4 Determination of the Optimal Amount of Outside Financing, K*\nAssume for the moment that the owner of a project (i.e., the owner of a prospective firm)\nhas enough wealth to finance the entire project himself.  The optimal scale of the corporation is\nthen determined by the condition that, ∆V-∆I = 0.  In general if the returns to the firm are\nuncertain the owner-manager can increase his welfare by selling off part of the firm either as debt\nor equity and reinvesting the proceeds in other assets.  If he does this with the optimal combination\nof debt and equity (as in fig. 6) the total wealth reduction he will incur is given by the agency cost\nfunction, Aτ(E*,K;V*) in fig. 7. The functions Aτ(E*,K;V*) will be S shaped (as drawn) if total\nagency costs for a given scale of firm increase at an increasing rate at low levels of outside\nfinancing, and at a decreasing rate for high levels of outside financing as monitoring imposes more\nand more constraints on the manager’s actions.\nFigure 8 shows marginal agency costs as a function of K, the fraction of the firm financed\nwith outside funds assuming the total agency cost function is as plotted in fig. 7, and assuming the\nscale of the firm is fixed. The demand by the owner-manager for outside financing is shown by\nthe remaining curve in fig. 8.  This curve represents the marginal value of the increased\ndiversification which the manager can obtain by reducing his ownership claims and optimally\nconstructing a diversified portfolio.  It is measured by the amount he would pay to be allowed to\nreduce his ownership claims by a dollar in order to increase his diversification. If the liquidation of\nsome of his holdings also influences the owner-manager’s consumption set, the demand function\nplotted in fig. 8 also incorporates the marginal value of these effects. The intersection of these two\nschedules determines the optimal fraction of the firm to be held by outsiders and this in turn\ndetermines the total agency costs borne by the owner.  This solution is Pareto optimal; there is no\nway to reduce the agency costs without making someone worse off.\nJensen and Meckling\n62\n1976\nFig. 8.\nDetermination of the optimal amount of outside financing, K*, for a given scale of firm.\n5.5 Determination of the Optimal Scale of the Firm\nWhile the details of the solution of the optimal scale of the firm are complicated when we\nallow for the issuance of debt, equity and monitoring and bonding, the general structure of the\nsolution is analogous to the case where monitoring and bonding are allowed for the outside equity\nexample (see fig. 4).\nIf it is optimal to issue any debt, the expansion path taking full account of such\nopportunities must lie above the curve ZG in fig. 4.  If this new expansion path lies anywhere to\nthe right of the indifference curve passing through point G debt will be used in the optimal\nfinancing package.  Furthermore, the optimal scale of the firm will be determined by the point at\nwhich this new expansion path touches the highest indifference curve.  In this situation the\nresulting level of the owner-manager’s welfare must therefore be higher.\nJensen and Meckling\n63\n1976\n6.    Qualifications and Extensions of the Analysis\n6.1 Multiperiod aspects of the agency problem\nWe have assumed throughout our analysis that we are dealing only with a single\ninvestment–financing decision by the entrepreneur and have ignored the issues associated with the\nincentives affecting future financing–investment decisions which might arise after the initial set of\ncontracts are consummated between the entrepreneur–manager, outside stockholders and\nbondholders.  These are important issues which are left for future analysis.64  Their solution will\nundoubtedly introduce some changes in the conclusions of the single decision analysis.  It seems\nclear, for instance, that the expectation of future sales of outside equity and debt will change the\ncosts and benefits facing the manager in making decisions which benefit himself at the (short–run)\nexpense of the current bondholders and stockholders.  If he develops a reputation for such\ndealings, he can expect this to unfavorably influence the terms at which he can obtain future\ncapital from outside sources.  This will tend to increase the benefits associated with “sainthood”\nand will tend to reduce the size of the agency costs.  Given the finite life of any individual,\nhowever, such an effect cannot reduce these costs to zero, because at some point these future\ncosts will begin to weigh more heavily on his successors and therefore the relative benefits to him\nof acting in his own best interests will rise.65  Furthermore, it will generally be impossible for him\nto fully guarantee the outside interests that his successor will continue to follow his policies.\n64 The recent work of Myers (1975) which views future investment opportunities as options and investigates\nthe incentive effects of the existence of debt in such a world where a sequence of investment decisions is\nmade is another important step in the investigation of the multiperiod aspects of the agency problem and the\ntheory of the firm.\n65 Becker and Stigler (1972) analyze a special case of this problem involving the use of nonvested pension\nrights to help correct for this end game play in the law enforcement area.\nJensen and Meckling\n64\n1976\n6.2 The Control Problem and Outside Owner’s Agency Costs\nThe careful reader will notice that nowhere in the analysis thus far have we taken into\naccount many of the details of the relationship between the part owner–manager and the outside\nstockholders and bondholders.  In particular, we have assumed that all outside equity is nonvoting.\nIf such equity does have voting rights, then the manager will be concerned about the effects on his\nlong–run welfare of reducing his fractional ownership below the point where he loses effective\ncontrol of the corporation.  That is, below the point where it becomes possible for the outside\nequity holders to fire him.  A complete analysis of this issue will require a careful specification of\nthe contractual rights involved on both sides, the role of the board of directors, and the\ncoordination (agency) costs borne by the stockholders in implementing policy changes.  This latter\npoint involves consideration of the distribution of the outside ownership claims.  Simply put, forces\nexist to determine an equilibrium distribution of outside ownership.  If the costs of reducing the\ndispersion of ownership are lower than the benefits to be obtained from reducing the agency costs,\nit will pay some individual or group of individuals to buy shares in the market to reduce the\ndispersion of ownership.  We occasionally witness these conflicts for control which involve\noutright market purchases, tender offers, and proxy fights.  Further analysis of these issues is left\nto the future.\n6.3 A Note on the Existence of Inside Debt and Some Conjectures on the Use of Convertible\nFinancial Instruments\nWe have been asked66 why debt held by the manager (i.e., “inside debt”) plays no role in\nour analysis.  We have as yet been unable to incorporate this dimension formally into our analysis\nin a satisfactory way.  The question is a good one and suggests some potentially important\n66  By our colleague David Henderson.\nJensen and Meckling\n65\n1976\nextensions of the analysis.  For instance, it suggests an inexpensive way for the owner–manager\nwith both equity and debt outstanding to eliminate a large part (perhaps all) of the agency costs of\ndebt.  If he binds himself contractually to hold a fraction of the total debt equal to his fractional\nownership of the total equity he would have no incentive whatsoever to reallocate wealth from the\ndebt holders to the stockholders.  Consider the case where\nBi/Si  =  Bo /So,\n(4)\nwhere Si and So are as defined earlier, Bi is the dollar value of the inside debt held by the owner–\nmanager, and Bo is the debt held by outsiders.  In this case, if the manager changes the investment\npolicy of the firm to reallocate wealth between the debt and equity holders, the net effect on the\ntotal value of his holdings in the firm will be zero.  Therefore, his incentives to perform such\nreallocations are zero.67\nWhy then don’t we observe practices or formal contracts which accomplish this\nelimination or reduction of the agency costs of debt?  Maybe we do for smaller privately held\nfirms (we haven’t attempted to obtain this data), but for large diffuse owner corporations the\npractice does not seem to be common.  One reason for this we believe is that in some respects\nthe claim that the manager holds on the firm in the form of his wage contract has some of the\ncharacteristics of debt.68  If true, this implies that even with zero holdings of formal debt claims he\nstill has positive holdings of a quasi–debt claim and this may accomplish the satisfaction of\ncondition (4).  The problem here is that any formal analysis of this issue requires a much deeper\n67 This also suggests that some outside debt holders can protect themselves from ‘exploitation’ by the\nmanager by purchasing a fraction of the total equity equal to their fractional ownership of the debt.  All debt\nholders, of course, cannot do this unless the manager does so also.  In addition, such an investment rule\nrestricts the portfolio choices of investors and therefore would impose costs if followed rigidly.  Thus the\nagency costs will not be eliminated this way either.\n68 Consider the situation in which the bondholders have the right in the event of bankruptcy to terminate his\nemployment and therefore to terminate the future returns to any specific human capital or rents he may be\nreceiving.\nJensen and Meckling\n66\n1976\nunderstanding of the relationship between formal debt holdings and the wage contract; i.e., how\nmuch debt is it equivalent to?\nThis line of thought also suggests some other interesting issues.  Suppose the implicit debt\ncharacteristics of the manager’s wage contract result in a situation equivalent to\nBi/Si  =>  Bo /So.\nThen he would have incentives to change the operating characteristics of the firm (i.e.,\nreduce the variance of the outcome distribution) to transfer wealth from the stockholders to the\ndebt holders which is the reverse of the situation we examined in section 4.  Furthermore, this\nseems to capture some of the concern often expressed regarding the fact that managers of large\npublicly held corporations seem to behave in a risk–averse way to the detriment of the equity\nholders.  One solution to this would be to establish incentive compensation systems for the\nmanager or to give him stock options which in effect give him a claim on the upper tail of the\noutcome distribution.  This also seems to be a commonly observed phenomenon.\nThis analysis also suggests some additional issues regarding the costs and benefits\nassociated with the use of more complicated financial claims such as warrants, convertible bonds,\nand convertible preferred stock which we have not formally analyzed as yet.  Warrants,\nconvertible bonds, and convertible preferred stock have some of the characteristics of non–voting\nshares although they can be converted into voting shares under some terms.  Alchian–Demsetz\n(1972) provide an interesting analysis regarding the use of non–voting shares.  They argue that\nsome shareholders with strong beliefs in the talents and judgments of the manager will want to be\nprotected against the possibility that some other shareholders will take over and limit the actions of\nthe manager (or fire him).  Given that the securities exchanges prohibit the use of non–voting\nshares by listed firms, the use of the option–type securities might be a substitute for these claims.\nJensen and Meckling\n67\n1976\nIn addition, warrants represent a claim on the upper tail of the distribution of outcomes,\nand convertible securities can be thought of as securities with non–detachable warrants.  It seems\nthat the incentive effect of warrants would tend to offset to some extent the incentive effects of\nthe existence of risky debt because the owner–manager would be sharing part of the proceeds\nassociated with a shift in the distribution of returns with the warrant holders.  Thus, we conjecture\nthat potential bondholders will find it attractive to have warrants attached to the risky debt of firms\nin which it is relatively easy to shift the distribution of outcomes to expand the upper tail of the\ndistribution to transfer wealth from bondholders.  It would also then be attractive to the owner–\nmanager because of the reduction in the agency costs which he would bear.  This argument also\nimplies that it would make little difference if the warrants were detachable (and therefore saleable\nseparately from the bonds) since their mere existence would reduce the incentives of the manager\n(or stockholders) to increase the riskiness of the firm (and therefore increase the probability of\nbankruptcy).  Furthermore, the addition of a conversion privilege to fixed claims such as debt or\npreferred stock would also tend to reduce the incentive effects of the existence of such fixed\nclaims and therefore lower the agency costs associated with them.  The theory predicts that these\nphenomena should be more frequently observed in cases where the incentive effects of such fixed\nclaims are high than when they are low.\n6.4 Monitoring and the Social Product of Security Analysts\nOne of the areas in which further analysis is likely to lead to high payoffs is that of\nmonitoring.  We currently have little which could be glorified by the title of a “Theory of\nMonitoring” and yet this is a crucial building block of the analysis.  We would expect monitoring\nactivities to become specialized to those institutions and individuals who possess comparative\nadvantages in these activities.  One of the groups who seem to play a large role in these activities\nis composed of the security analysts employed by institutional investors, brokers and investment\nJensen and Meckling\n68\n1976\nadvisory services as well as the analysis performed by individual investors in the normal course of\ninvestment decision making.\nA large body of evidence exists which indicates that security prices incorporate in an\nunbiased manner all publicly available information and much of what might be called “private\ninformation”.69  There is also a large body of evidence which indicates that the security analysis\nactivities of mutual funds and other institutional investors are not reflected in portfolio returns, i.e.,\nthey do not increase risk–adjusted portfolio returns over a naive random selection buy–and–hold\nstrategy.70  Therefore, some have been tempted to conclude that the resources expended on such\nresearch activities to find under– or over–valued securities is a social loss.  Jensen (1979) argues\nthat this conclusion cannot be unambiguously drawn because there is a large consumption element\nin the demand for these services.\nFurthermore, the analysis of this paper would seem to indicate that to the extent that\nsecurity analysis activities reduce the agency costs associated with the separation of ownership\nand control, they are indeed socially productive.  Moreover, if this is true, we expect the major\nbenefits of the security analysis activity to be reflected in the higher capitalized value of the\nownership claims to corporations and not in the period–to–period portfolio returns of the analyst.\nEquilibrium in the security analysis industry requires that the private returns to analysis (i.e.,\nportfolio returns) must be just equal to the private costs of such activity,71 and this will not reflect\nthe social product of this activity which will consist of larger output and higher levels of the capital\nvalue of ownership claims.  Therefore, the argument implies that if there is a non–optimal amount\n69  See Fama (1970a) for a survey of this ‘efficient markets’ literature.\n70  See Jensen (1969) for an example of this evidence and references.\n71 Ignoring any pure consumption elements in the demand for security analysis\nJensen and Meckling\n69\n1976\nof security analysis being performed, it is too much72 not too little (since the shareholders would be\nwilling to pay directly to have the “optimal” monitoring performed), and we don’t seem to observe\nsuch payments.\n6.5 Specialization in the Use of Debt and Equity\nOur previous analysis of agency costs suggests at least one other testable hypothesis:  i.e.,\nthat in those industries where the incentive effects of outside equity or debt are widely different,\nwe would expect to see specialization in the use of the low agency cost financing arrangement.  In\nindustries where it is relatively easy for managers to lower the mean value of the outcomes of the\nenterprise by outright theft, special treatment of favored customers, ease of consumption of leisure\non the job, etc. (for example, the bar and restaurant industry), we would expect to see the\nownership structure of firms characterized by relatively little outside equity (i.e., 100 percent\nownership of the equity by the manager) with almost all outside capital obtained through the use of\ndebt.\nThe theory predicts the opposite would be true where the incentive effects of debt are\nlarge relative to the incentive effects of equity.  Firms like conglomerates, in which it would be\neasy to shift outcome distributions adversely for bondholders (by changing the acquisition or\ndivestiture policy) should be characterized by relatively lower utilization of debt.  Conversely, in\nindustries where the freedom of management to take riskier projects is severely constrained (for\nexample, regulated industries such as public utilities), we should find more intensive use of debt\nfinancing.\nThe analysis suggests that in addition to the fairly well–understood role of uncertainty in\nthe determination of the quality of collateral, there is at least one other element of great\n72 Again ignoring the value of the pure consumption elements in the demand for security analysis.\nJensen and Meckling\n70\n1976\nimportance—the ability of the owner of the collateral to change the distribution of outcomes by\nshifting either the mean outcome or the variance of the outcomes.  A study of bank lending\npolicies should reveal these to be important aspects of the contractual practices observed there.\n6.6 Application of the Analysis to the Large Diffuse Ownership Corporation\nWhile we believe the structure outlined in the proceeding pages is applicable to a wide\nrange of corporations, it is still in an incomplete state.  One of the most serious limitations of the\nanalysis is that, as it stands, we have not worked out in this paper its application to the very large\nmodern corporation whose managers own little or no equity.  We believe our approach can be\napplied to this case, but space limitations preclude discussion of these issues here.  They remain to\nbe worked out in detail and will be included in a future paper.\n6.7  The Supply Side of the Incomplete Markets Question\nThe analysis of this paper is also relevant to the incomplete market issue considered by\nArrow (1964a), Diamond (1967), Hakansson (1974a, 1974b), Rubinstein (1974), Ross (1974b), and\nothers.  The problems addressed in this literature derive from the fact that whenever the available\nset of financial claims on outcomes in a market fails to span the underlying state space (see\nArrow, 1964a,  andDebreu, 1959) the resulting allocation is Pareto inefficient.  A disturbing\nelement in this literature surrounds the fact that the inefficiency conclusion is generally drawn\nwithout explicit attention in the analysis to the costs of creating new claims or of maintaining the\nexpanded set of markets called for to bring about the welfare improvement.\nThe demonstration of a possible welfare improvement from the expansion of the set of\nclaims by the introduction of new basic contingent claims or options can be thought of as an\nanalysis of the demand conditions for new markets.  Viewed from this perspective, what is\nmissing in the literature on this problem is the formulation of a positive analysis of the supply of\nJensen and Meckling\n71\n1976\nmarkets (or the supply of contingent claims).  That is, what is it in the maximizing behavior of\nindividuals in the economy that causes them to create and sell contingent claims of various sorts?\nThe analysis in this paper can be viewed as a small first step in the direction of\nformulating an analysis of the supply of markets issue which is founded in the self–interested\nmaximizing behavior of individuals.  We have shown why it is in the interest of a wealth–\nmaximizing entrepreneur to create and sell claims such as debt and equity.  Furthermore, as we\nhave indicated above, it appears that extensions of these arguments will lead to a theory of the\nsupply of warrants, convertible bonds, and convertible preferred stock.  We are not suggesting\nthat the specific analysis offered above is likely to be sufficient to lead to a theory of the supply of\nthe wide range of contracts (both existing and merely potential) in the world at large.  However,\nwe do believe that framing the question of the completeness of markets in terms of the joining of\nboth the demand and supply conditions will be very fruitful instead of implicitly assuming that new\nclaims spring forth from some (costless) well head of creativity unaided or unsupported by human\neffort.\n7.    Conclusions\nThe publicly held business corporation is an awesome social invention.  Millions of\nindividuals voluntarily entrust billions of dollars, francs, pesos, etc. of personal wealth to the care\nof managers on the basis of a complex set of contracting relationships which delineate the rights\nof the parties involved.  The growth in the use of the corporate form as well as the growth in\nmarket value of established corporations suggests that at least, up to the present, creditors and\ninvestors have by and large not been disappointed with the results, despite the agency costs\ninherent in the corporate form.\nJensen and Meckling\n72\n1976\nAgency costs are as real as any other costs.  The level of agency costs depends, among\nother things, on statutory and common law and human ingenuity in devising contracts.  Both the\nlaw and the sophistication of contracts relevant to the modern corporation are the products of a\nhistorical process in which there were strong incentives for individuals to minimize agency costs.\nMoreover, there were alternative organizational forms available, and opportunities to invent new\nones.  Whatever its shortcomings, the corporation has thus far survived the market test against\npotential alternatives.\nReferences\nAlchian, Armen A.

Myers\n#1548-84\nApril 1984\nTHE CAPITAL STRUCTURE PUZZLE\nStewart C. Myers*\nThis paper's title is intended to remind you of Fischer Black's well-known\nnote on \"The Dividend Puzzle,\" which he closed by saying, \"What should the\ncorporation do about dividend polic ? We don't know.\" [6, p.8]\nI will start\nby asking, \"How do firms choose their capital structures?\" Again, the answer\nis, \"We don't know.\"\nThe capital structure puzzle is tougher than the dividend one.\nWe know\nquite a bit about dividend policy. John Lintner's model of how firms set\ndividends [19] dates back to 1956, and it still seems to work. We know stock\nprices respond to unanticipated dividend changes, so it is clear that\ndividends have information content--this observation dates back at least to\nMiller and Modigliani (MM) in 1961 [27].\nWe do not know whether high dividend\nyield increases the expected rate of return demanded by investors, as adding\ntaxes to the MM proof of dividend irrelevance suggests, but financial\neconomists are at least hammering away at this issue.\nBy contrast, we know very little about capital structure. We do not know\nhow firms choose the ebt, equity or hybrid securities they issue. We have\nonly recently discovered that capital structure changes convey information to\ninvestors. There has been little if any research testing whether the\nrelationship between financial leverage and investors' required return is as\n-2-\nthe pure MM theory predicts.\nIn general, we have inadequate understanding of\ncorporate financing behavior, and of how that behavior affects security\nreturns.\nI do not want to sound too pessimistic or discouraged. We have\naccumulated many helpful insights into capital structure choice, starting with\nthe most important one, MM's No Magic in Leverage Theorem (Proposition I)\n[31].\nWe have thought long and hard about what these insights imply for\noptimal capital structure. Many of us have translated these theories, or\nstories, of optimal capital structure into more or less definite advice to\nmanagers. But our theories don't seem to explain actual financing behavior,\nand it seems presumptuous to advise firms on optimal capital structure when we\nare so far from explaining actual decisions. I have done more than my share\nof writing on optimal capital structure, so I take this opportunity to make\namends, and to try to push research in some new directions.\nI will contrast two ways of thinking about capital structure:\n1. A static tradeoff framework, in which the firm is viewed as\nsetting a target debt-to-value ratio and gradually moving towards it, in\nmuch the same way that a firm adjusts dividends to move towards a target\npayout ratio.\n2. An old-fashioned pecking order framework, in which the firm\nprefers internal to external financing, and debt to equity if it issues\nsecurities. In the pure pecking order theory, the firm has no\nwell-defined target debt-to-value ratio.\nRecent theoretical work has breathed new life into the pecking order\nframework. I will argue that this theory performs at least as well as the\nstatic tradeoff theory in explaining what we know about actual financing\n-3-\nchoices and their average impacts on stock prices.\nManagerial and Neutral Mutation Hypotheses\nI have arbitrarily, and probably unfairly, excluded \"managerial\" theories\nwhich might explain firmis' capital structure choices.\nI have chosen not to\nconsider models which cut the umbilical cord that ties managers' acts to\nstockholders' interests.\n,,\n2\nI am also sidestepping Miller's idea of \"neutral mutation.\"\nHe\nsuggests that firms fall into some financing patterns or habits which have no\nmaterial effect on firm value. The habits may make managers feel better, and\nsince they do no harm, no one cares to stop or change them. Thus someone who\nidentifies these habits and uses them to predict financing behavior would not\nbe explaining anything important.\nThe neutral mutations idea is important as a warning. Given time and\nimagination, economists can usually invent some model that assigns apparent\neconomic rationality to any random event.\nBut taking neutral mutation as a\nstrict null hypothesis makes the game of research too tough to play. If an\neconomist identifies costs of various financing strategies, obtains\nindependent evidence that the costs are really there, and then builds a model\nbased on these costs which explains firms' financing behavior, then some\nprogress has been made, even if it proves difficult to demonstrate that, say,\na type A financing strategy gives higher firm value than a type B. (In fact,\nwe would never see type B if all firms follow value-maximizing strategies.)\nThere is another reason for not immediately embracing neutral mutations:\nwe know investors are interested in the firm's financing choices, because\n-4-\nstock prices change when the choices are announced. The change might be\nexplained as an \"information effect\" having nothing to do with financing per\nse--but again, it is a bit too easy to wait until the results of an event\nstudy are in, and then to think of an information story to explain them. On\nthe other hand, if one starts by assuming that managers have special\ninformation, builds a model of how that information changes financing choices,\nand predicts which choices will be interpreted by investors as good or bad\nnews, then some progress has been made.\nSo this paper is designed as a one-on-one competition of the static\ntradeoff and pecking-order stories.\nIf neither story explains actual\nbehavior, the neutral mutations story will be there faithfully waiting.\nThe Static Tradeoff Hypothesis\nA firm's optimal debt ratio is usually viewed as determined by a tradeoff\nof the costs and benefits of borrowing, holding the firm's assets and\ninvestment plans constant. The firm is portrayed as balancing the value of\ninterest tax shields against various costs of bankruptcy or financial\nembarassment. Of course, there is controversy about how valuable the tax\nshields are, and which, if any, of the costs of financial embarassment are\nmaterial, but these disagreements give only variations on a theme. The firm\nis supposed to substitute debt for equity, or equity for debt, until the value\nof the firm is maximized. Thus the debt-equity tradeoff is as illustrated in\nFig. 1.\nCosts of adjustment. If there were no costs of adjustment, and the static\ntradeoff theory is correct, then each firm's observed debt-to-value ratio\n-5-\nshould be its optimal ratio. However, there must be costs, and therefore\nlags, in adjusting to the optimum. Firms can not immediately offset the\nrandom events that bump them away from the optimum, so there should be some\ncross-sectional dispersion of actual debt ratios across a sample of firms\nhaving the same target ratio.\nLarge adjustment costs could possibly explain the observed wide variation\nin actual debt ratios, since firms would be forced into long excursions away\nfrom their optimal ratios. But there is nothing in the usual static tradeoff\nstories suggesting that adjustment costs are a first-order concern-in fact,\nthey are rarely mentioned. Invoking them withoat modelling them is a cop-out.\nAny cross-sectional test of financing behavior should specify whether\nfirms' debt ratios differ because they have different optimal ratios or\nbecause their actual ratios diverge from optimal ones. It is easy to get the\ntwo cases mixed up. For example, think of the early cross-sectional studies\nwhich attempted to test MM's Proposition I. These studies tried to find out\nwhether differences in leverage affected the market value of the firm (or the\nmarket capitalization rate for its operating income).\nWith hindsight, we can\nquickly see the problem:\nif adjustment costs are small, and each firm in the\nsample is at, or close to its optimum, then the in-sample dispersion of debt\nratios must reflect differences in risk or in other variables affecting\noptimal capital structure. But then MM's Proposition I cannot be tested\nunless the effects of risk and other variables on firm value can be adjusted\nfor. By now we have learned from experience how hard it is to hold \"other\nthings constant\" in cross-sectional regressions.\nOf course, one way to make sense of these tests is to assume that\nadjustment costs are small, but managers don't know, or don't care, what the\n-6-\noptimal debt ratio is, and thus do not stay close to it. The researcher then\nassumes some (usually unspecified) \"managerial\" theory of capital structure\nchoice. This may be a convenient assumption for a cross-sectional test of\nMM's Proposition I, but not very helpful if the object is to understand\n3\nfinancing behavior.\nBut suppose we don't take this \"managerial\" fork. Then if adjustment\ncosts are small, and firms stay near their target debt ratios, I find it hard\nto understand the observed diversity of capital structures across firms that\nseem similar in a static tradeoff framework. If adjustment costs are large,\nso that some firms take extended excursions away from their targets, then we\nought to give less attention to refining our static tradeoff stories and\nrelatively more to understanding what the adjustment costs are, why they are\nso important, and how rational managers would respond to them.\nBut I am getting ahead of my story. On to debt and taxes.\nDebt and taxes. Miller's famous \"Debt and Taxes\" paper [26] cut us loose\nfrom the extreme implications of the original MM theory, which made interest\ntax shields so valuable that we could not explain why all firms were not awash\nin debt. Miller described an equilibrium of aggregate supply and demand for\ncoporate debt, in which personal income taxes paid by the marginal investor in\ncorporate debt just offset the corporate tax saving. However, since the\nequilibrium only determines aggregates, debt policy should not matter for any\nsingle tax-paying firm. Thus Miller's model allows us to explain the\ndispersion of actual debt policies without having to introduce\n4\nnon-value-maximizing managers.\nTrouble is, this explanation works only if we assume that all firms face\napproximately the same marginal tax rate, and that is an assumption we can\n-7-\nimmediately reject. The extensive trading of depreciation tax shields and\ninvestment tax credits, through financial leases and other devices, proves\nthat plenty of firms face low marginal rates.5\nGiven significant differences in effective marginal tax rates, and given\nthat the static tradeoff theory works, we would expect to find a strong tax\neffect in any cross-sectional test, regardless of whose theory of debt and\ntaxes you believe.\nFigure 2 plots the net tax gain from corporate borrowing against the\nexpected realizable tax shield from a future deduction of one dollar of\ninterest paid. For some firms this number is 46 cents, or close to it. At\nthe other extreme, there are firms with large unused loss carryforwards which\npay no immediate taxes. An extra dollar of interest paid by these firms would\ncreate only a potential future deduction, usable when and if the firm earns\nenough to work off prior carryforwards. The expected realizable tax shield is\npositive but small. Also, there are firms paying taxes today which cannot be\nsure they will do so in the future. Such a firm values expected future\ninterest tax shields at somewhere between zero and the full statutory rate.\nIn the \"corrected\" MM theory [28] any tax-paying corporation gains by\nborrowing; the greater the marginal tax rate, the greater the gain. This\ngives the top line in the figure.\nIn Miller's theory, the personal income\ntaxes on interest payments would exactly offset the corporate interest tax\nshield, provided that the firm pays the full statutory :ax rate. However, any\nfirm paying a lower rate would see a net loss to corporate borrowing and a net\ngain to lending. This gives the bottom line.\nThere are also compromise theories, advanced by D'Angelo and Masulis [12],\nModigliani [30] and others, indicated by he middle dashed line in the\n-8-\nfigure. The compromise theories are appealing because they seem less extreme\nthan either the MM or Miller theories.\nBut regardless of which theory-\nholds, the slope of the line is always positive. The difference between (1)\nthe tax advantage of borrowing to firms facing the full statutory rate, and\n(2) the tax advantage of lending (or at least not borrowing) to firms with\nlarge tax loss carryforwards, is exactly the same as in the \"extreme\"\ntheories. Thus, although the theories tell different stories about aggregate\nsupply and demand of corporate debt, they make essentially the same\npredictions abot which firms borrow more or less than average.\nSo the tax side of the static tradeoff theory predicts that IBM should\nborrow more than Bethlehem Steel, other things equal, and that General Motors'\ndebt-to-value ratio should be more than Chrysler's.\nCosts of financial distress. Costs of financial distress include the\nlegal and administrative costs of bankruptcy, as well as the subtler agency,\nmoral hazard, monitoring and contracting costs which can erode firm value even\nif formal default is avoided. We know these costs exist, although we may\ndebate their magnitude. For example, there is no satisfactory explanation of\ndebt covenants unless agency costs and moral hazard problems are recognized.\nThe literature on costs of financial distress supports two qualitative\nstatements about financing behavior.6\n1. Risky firms ouaght to borrow less, other things equal.\nHere\n\"risk\" would be defined as the variance rate of the market value of the\nfirm's assets.\nThe higher the variance rate, the greater the probability\nof default on any given package of debt claims. Since costs of financial\ndistress are caused by threatened or actual default, safe firms oaght to\n-9-\nbe able to borrow more before expected costs of financial distress offset\nthe tax advantages of borrowing.\n2. Firms holding tangible assets-in-place having active second-hand\nmarkets will borrow less than firms holding specialized, intangible assets\nor valuable growth opportunities.\nThe expected cost of financial distress\ndepends not just on the probability of trouble, but the value lost if\ntroible comes. Specialized, intangible assets or growth opportunities are\nmore likely to lose value in financial distress.\nThe Pecking Order Theory\nContrast the static tradeoff the ry with a competing popular story based\non a financing pecking order:\n1. Firms prefer internal finance.\n2. They adapt their target dividend payout ratios to their\ninvestment opportunities, although dividends are sticky and target payout\nratios are only gradually adjusted to shifts in the extent of valuable\ninvestment opportunities.\n3. Sticky dividend policies, plus unpredictable fluctuations in\nprofitability and investment opportunities, mean that internally-generated\ncash flow may be more or less than investment outlays.\nIf it is less, the\nfirm first draws down its cash balance or marketable securities portfolio.\n4. If external finance is required, firms issue the safest security\nfirst. That is, they start with debt, then possibly hybrid securities\nsuch as convertible bonds, then perhaps equity as a last resort.\nIn this story, there is no well-defined target debt-equity mix, because\n-10-\nthere are two kinds of equity, internal and external, one at the top of the\npecking order and one at the bottom. Each firm's observed debt ratio reflects\nits cumulative requirements for external finance.\nThe pecking order literature. The pecking order hypothesis is hardly\nnew.8 For example, it comes through loud and clear in Donaldson's 1961\nstudy of the financing practices of a sample of large corporations. He\nobserved [13, p. 67] that \"Management strongly favored internal generation as\na source of new funds even to the exclusion of external funds except for\noccasional unavoidable 'bulges' in the need for funds.\" These bulges were not\ngenerally met by cutting dividends: Reducing \"the customary cash dividend\npayment ... was unthinkable to most managements except as a defensive measure\nin a period of extreme financial distress.\" (p. 70) Given that external\nfinance was needed, managers rarely thought of issuing stock:\nThough few companies would go so far as to rule out a sale\nof common under any circumstances, the large majority had\nnot had such a sale in the past 20 years and did not\nanticipate one in the foreseeable future. This was\nparticularly remarkable in view of the very high\nPrice-Earnings ratios of recent years. Several financial\nofficers showed that they were well aware that this had\nbeen a good time to sell common, but the reluctance still\npersisted. (p. 57-58)\nOf course, the pecking order hypothesis can be quickly rejected if we\nrequire it to explain everything. There are plenty of examples of firms\nissuing stock when they could issue investment-grade debt. But when one looks\nat aggregates, the heavy reliance on internal finance and debt is clear. For\nall non-financial corporations over the decade 1973-1982, internally generated\ncash covered, on average, 62 percent of capital expenditures, including\ninvestment in inventory and other current assets. The bulk of required\nexternal financing came from borrowing. Net new stock issues were never more\n-11-\nthan 6 percent of external financing.\nAnyone innocent of modern finance\nwho looked at these statistics would find the pecking order idea entirely\nplausible, at least as a description of typical behavior.\nWriters on \"managerial capitalism\" have interpreted firm's reliance on\ninternal finance as a byproduct of the separation of ownership and control:\nprofessional managers avoid relying on external finance because it would\nsubject them to the discipline of the capital market.\nDonaldson's books\nwas not primarily about managerial capitalism, but he nevertheless observed\nthat the financing decisions of the firms he studied were not directed towards\nmaximizing shareholder wealth, and that scholars attempting to explain those\ndecisions would have to start by recognizing the \"managerial view\" of\ncorporate finance. [14, Ch. 2]\nThis conclusion is natural given the state of finance theory in the\n1960s.\nToday, it is not so obvious that financing by a pecking order goes\nagainst shareholders' interests.\nExternal financing with asymmetric information. I used to ignore the\npecking order story because I could think of no theoretical foundation for it\nthat would fit in with the theory of modern finance. An argument could be\nmade for internal financing to avoid issue costs, and if external finance is\nneeded, for debt to avoid the still higher issue costs of equity. But issue\ncosts in themselves do not seem large enough to override the costs and\nbenefits of leverage emphasized in the static tradeoff story. However, recent\nwork based on asymmetric information gives predictions roughly in line with\nthe pecking order theory. The following brief exposition is based on a\nforthcoming joint paper by me and Nicholas Majluf [34], although I will here\nboil down that paper's argument to absolute essentials.\n-12-\nSuppose the firm has to raise N dollars in order to undertake some\npotentially valuable investment opportunity. Let y be this opportunity's\nnet present value (NPV) and x be what the firm will be worth if the\nopportunity is passed by. The firm's manager knows what x and y are, but\ninvestors in capital markets do not: they see only a joint distribution of\npossible values (x, y). The information asymmetry is taken as given. Aside\nfrom the information asymmetry, capital markets are perfect and semi-strong\nform efficient. MM's Proposition I holds in the sense that the stock of debt\nrelative to real assets is irrelevant if information available to investors is\nheld constant.\nThe benefit to raising N dollars by a security issue is y, the NPV of\nthe firm's investment opportunity. There is also a possible cost: the firm\nmay have to sell the securities for less than they are really worth. Suppose\nthe firm issues stock with an aggregate market value value, when issued, of\nN. (I will consider debt issues in a moment.)\nHowever, the manager knows the\nshares are really worth N1 .\nThat is,\nN1\nis what the new shares will\nbe worth, other things equal, when investors acquire the manager's special\nknowledge.\nMajluf and I discuss several possible objectives managers might pursue in\nthis situation. The one we think makes the most sense is maximizing the\n\"true,\" or \"intrinsic\" value of the firm's existing shares. That is, the\nmanager worries about the value of the \"old\" shareholders' stake in the firm.\nMoreover, investors know the manager will do this. In particular, the \"new\"\ninvestors who purchase any stock issue will assume that the manager is not on\ntheir side, and will rationally adjust the price they are willing to pay.\nDefine AN as the amount by which the shares are over- or undervalued:\n-13-\nAN\nN1 - N .\nThen the manager will issue and invest when\ny\nN\n.\n(1)\nIf the manager's inside information is unfavorable, AN is negative and the\nfirm will always issue, even the only good use for the funds raised is to put\nthem in the bank--a zero-NPV investment.\nIf the inside information is\nfavorable, however, the firm may pass up a positive-NPV investment opportunity\nrather than issue undervalued shares.\nBut if management acts this way, its decision to issue will signal bad\nnews to both old and new shareholders. Let V be the market value of firm\n(price per share times number of shares) it does not issue, and V' be market\nvalue if it does issue; V' includes the value of the newly-issued shares.\nThus, if everyone knows that managers will act according to Ineqality (1),\nthe conditions for a rational expectations equilibrium are:1 2\nV = E(xlno issue)\nE(xly < AN)\n(2a)\n,.\n'V\n'V\n'V\nV'\nE(x + y + Nlissue) = E(x + y + Ny\nAN)\n.\n(2b)\nThe total dollar amount raised is fixed by assumption, but the number of new\nshares needed to raise that amount is not. Thus AN is endogenous:\nit depends\non V' .\nFor example, if the firm issues, the fraction of all shares held by \"new\"\nstockholders is N/V' .\nThe manager sees the true value of their claim as:\nN1\nV (x + y + N)\n(3)\nThus, given N, x and' y, and given that stock is issued, the greater the\nprice per share, the less value is given up to new stockholders, and the less\nAN is.\n-14-\nMajluf and I have discussed the assumptions and implications of this model\nin considerable detail.\nBut here are the two key points:\n1. The cost of relying on external financing. We usually think of the\ncost of external finance as administrative and underwriting costs, and in some\ncases underpricing of the new securities. Asymmetric information creates the\npossibility of a different sort of cost:\nthe possibility that the firm will\nchoose not to issue, and will therefore pass up a positive-NPV investment.\nThis cost is avoided if the firm can retain enough internaLty-generated cash\nto cover its positive-NPV opportunities.\n2. The advantages of debt over equity issues.\nIf the firm does seek\nexternal funds, it is better off issuing debt than equity securities.\nThe\ngeneral rule is, \"Issue safe securities before risky ones.\"\nThis second point is worth explaining further. Remember that the firm\nissues and invests if y, the NPV of its investment opportunity, is greater\nthan or equal to\nAN, the amount by which the new shares are undervalued\n(if AN > 0) or overvalued (if\nAN < 0).\nFor example, suppose the\ninvestment requires N -\n$10 million, but in order to raise that amount the\nfirm must issue shares that re really worth $12 million. It will go ahead\nonly if project NPV is at least $2 million.\nIf it is worth only $1.5 million,\nthe firm refuses to raise the money for it; the intrinsic overall value of the\nfirm is reduced by $1.5 million, but the old shareholders are $0.5 million\nbetter off.\nThe manager could have avoided this problem by building up the firm's cash\nreserves--but that is hindsight. The only thing he can do now is to redesign\nthe security issue to reduce AN.\nFor example, if AN could be cut to\n$0.5 million, the investment project could be financed without diluting the\n-15-\ntrue value of existing shares. The way to reduce AN is to issue the\nsafest possible securities--strictly speaking, securities whose future vaue\nchanges least when the manager's inside information is revealed to the market.\nOf course, AN is endogencas, so it is loose talk to speak of the\nmanager controlling it. However, there are reasonable cases in which the\nabsolute value of AN is always less for debt than for equity. For\nexample, if the firm can issue default-risk free debt,\nAN is zero, and the\nfirm never passes up a valuable investment opportunity. Thus, the ability to\nissue default-risk free debt is as good as cash in the bank. Even if default\nrisk is introduced, the absolute value of AN will be less for debt than\n13\nfor equity if we the customary assumptions of option pricing models.\nThus, if the manager has favorable information (AN > 0), it is better to\nissue debt than equity.\nThis example assumes that new shares or risky debt would be underpriced.\nWhat if the managers' inside information is unfavorable, so that any risky\nsecurity issue would be overpriced? In this case, wouldn't the firm want to\nmake AN as large as possible, to take maximum advantage of new investors?\nIf so, stock would seem better than debt (and warrants better still). The\ndecision rule seems to be, \"Issue debt when investors undervalue the firm, and\nequity, or some other risky security, when they overvalue it.\nThe trouble with this strategy is obvious once you put yourself in\ninvestors' shoes.\nIf you know the firm will issue equity only when it is\noverpriced, and debt otherwise, you will refuse to buy equity unless the firm\nhas already exhausted its \"debt capacity\"--that is, unless the firm has issued\nso much debt already that it would face substantial additional costs in\n-16-\nissuing more.\nThus investors would effectively force the firm to follow a\npecking order.\nNow this is clearly too extreme. The model just presented would need lots\nof fleshing out before it could fully capture actual behavior.\nI have\npresented it just to show how models based on asymmetric information can\npredict the two central ideas of the pecking order story:\nfirst, the\npreference for internal finance, and, second, the preference for debt over\nequity if external financing is sought.\nWhat We Know About Corporate Financing Behavior\nI will now list what we know about financing behavior and try o make\nsense of this knowledge in terms of the two hypotheses sketched above.\nI\nbegin with five facts about financing behavior, and then offer a few\ngeneralizations from weaker statistical evidence or personal observation. Of\ncoarse even \"facts\" based on apparently good statistics have been known to\nmelt away under further examination, so read with caution.\nInternal vs. external equity. Aggregate investment ouatlays are\npredominantly financed by debt issues and internally-generated funds. New\nstock issues play a relatively small part. Moreover, as Donaldson has\nobserved, this is what many managers say they are trying to do.\nThis fact is what suggested the pecking order hypothesis in the first\nplace.\nHowever, it might also be explained in a static tradeoff theory by\nadding significant transaction costs of equity issues and noting the favorable\ntax treatment of capital gains relative to dividends. This would make\nexternal equity relatively expensive. It would explain why companies keep\n-17-\ntarget dividend payouts low enough to avoid having to make regular stock\nissues. 14\nIt would also explain why a firm whose debt ratio soars above\ntarget does not immediately issue stock, buy back debt, and re-establish a\nmore moderate debt-to-value ratio. Thus firms might take extended excursions\nabove their debt targets. (Note, however, that the static tradeoff hypothesis\nas usually presented rarely mentions this kind of adjustment cost.)\nBut the out-of-pocket costs of repurchasing shares seem fairly small. It\nis thus hard to explain extended excursions below a firm's debt target by an\naugmented static tradeoff theory--the firm could quickly issue debt and buy\nback shares. Moreover, if personal income taxes are important in explaining\nfirms' apparent preferences for internal equity, then it's difficult to\nexplain why external equity is not strongly negative--that is, why most firms\nhaven't gradually moved to materially lower target payout ratios and used the\nreleased cash to repurchase shares.\nTiming of security issues. Firms apparently ry to \"time\" stock issues\nwhen security prices are \"high.\" Given that they seek external finance, they\nare more likely o issue stock (rather than debt) after stock prices have\nrisen than after they have fallen. For example, past stock price movements\nwere one of the best-performing variables in Marsh's study [21] of British\nfirms' choices between new debt and new equity issues. Taggart [39] and\n15\nothers\nhave found similar behavior in the United States.\nThis fact is embarassing to static tradeoff advocates. If firm value\nrises, the debt-to-value ratio faLLs, and firms ought to issue debt, not\nequity, to rebalance their capital structures.\nThe fact is equally embarrassing to the pecking order hypothesis. There\nis no reason to believe that the manager's inside information is\n-18-\nsystematically more favorable when stock prices are \"high.\" Even if there\nwere such a tendenc,\ninvestors would have learned it by now, and would\ninterpret the firm's issue decision accordingly. There is no way firms can\nsystematically take advantage of purchasers of new equity in a rational\nexpectations equilibrium.\nBorrowing against intangibles and growth opportunities. Firms holding\nvaluable intangible assets or growth opportunities tend to borrow less than\nfirms holding mostly :angible assets. For example, Long and MaLitz [20] foind\na significant negative relationship between rates of investment in advertising\nand research and development (R&D) and the level of borrowing. They also\nfound a significant positive relationship between the rate of capital\nexpenditure (in fixed plant and equipment) and the level of borrowing.\nWilliamson [14] reached the same conclusion by a different route. His\nproxy for a firm's intangibles and growth opportunities was the difference\nbetween the market value of its debt and equity securities and the replacement\ncost of its tangible assets. The higher this proxy, he found, the less the\nfirm's debt-to-value ratio.\nThere is plenty of indirect evidence indicating that the level of\nborrowing is determined not just by the value and risk of the firm's assets,\nbut also by :he type of assets it holds. For example, without this\ndistinction, the static tradeoff theory would specify all target debt ratios\nin terms of market, not book vaLues. Since many firms have market values far\nin excess of book values (even if those book values are restated in current\ndollars), we ought to see at least a few such firms operating comfortably at\nvery high book debt ratios--and of course we do not. This fact begins to make\nsense, however, as soon as we realize that book values reflect assets-in-place\n-19-\n(tangible assets and working capital). Market values reflect intangibles and\ngrowth opportunities as well as assets-in-place. Thus, firms do not set\ntarget book debt ratios because accountants certify the books. Book asset\nvalues are proxies for the values of assets in place.l6\nExchange offers. Masulis [22,23] has shown that stock prices rise, on\naverage, when a firm offers to exchange debt for equity, and fall when they\noffer to exchange equity for debt. This fact could be explained in variois\nways. For example, it might be a tax effect.\nIf most firms' debt ratios are\nbelow their optimal ratios (i.e., to the left of the optimum in Figure 1), and\nif corporate interest tax shields have significant positive value, then\ndebt-for-equity exchanges would tend to move firms closer to optimum capital\nstructure. Equity-for-debt swaps would tend to move them farther away.\nThe evidence on exchanges hardly builds confidence in the static tradeoff\ntheory as a description of financing behavior. If the theory were right,\nfirms wo ld be sometimes above, and sometimes below, their optimum ratios.\nThose above would offer to exchange equity for debt. Those below would offer\ndebt for equity. In both cases, the firm would move closer to the optimum.\nWhy should an exchange offer be good news if in one direction and bad news if\nin the ther?\nAs Masulis points out, the firm's willingness to exchange debt for equity\nmight signal that the firm's debt capacity had, in management's opinion,\nincreased. That is, it would signal an increase in firm value or a reduction\nin firm risk. Thus, a debt-for-equity exchange would be good news, and the\nopposite exchange bad news.\nThis \"information effect\" explanation for exchange offers is surely right\nin one sense. Any time an announcement affects stock price, we can infer that\n-20-\nthe announcement conveyed information. That is not much help except to prove\nthat managers have some information investors do not have.\nThe idea that an exchange offer reveals a change in the firm's target debt\nratio, and thereby signals changes in firm vaLue or risk, sounds plausible.\nBut an equally plausible stor can be told without saying anything about a\ntarget debt ratio. If the manager with superior information acts to maximize\nthe intrinsic value of existing shares, then the announcement of a stock issue\nshould be bad news, other things equal, because stock issues will be more\nlikely when the manager receives bad news.l\nOn the other hand, stock\nretirements should be good news. The news in both cases has no evident\nnecessary connection with shifts in target debt ratios.\nIt may be possible to build a model combining asymmetric information with\nthe costs and benefits of borrowing emphasized in static tradeoff stories. My\nguess, however, is that it will prove difficult to do this without also\nintroducing some elements of the pecking order story.\nIssue or repurchase of shares. The fifth fact is no surprise given the\nfourth. On average, stock price falls when firms announce a stock issue.\nStock prices rise, on average, when a stock repurchase is announced. This\nfact has been confirmed in several studies, including those by Korwar [18],\nAsquith and Mullins [2], Dann and Mikkleson [10], Vermaelen [40], and\nDeAngelo, DeAngelo and Rice [11].\nThis fact is again hard to explain by a static tradeoff model, except as\nan information effect in which stock issues or retirements signal changes in\nthe firm's target debt ratio. I've aready commented on that.\nThe simple asymmetric information model I used to motivate the pecking\norder hypothesis does predict that the announcement of a stock issue will\n-21-\ncause stock price to fall.\nIt also predicts that stock price should not faLl,\nother things equal, if default-risk debt is issued. Of course, no private\ncompany can issue debt that is absolutely protected from default, but it seems\nreasonable to predict that the average stock price impact of high-grade debt\nissues will be small relative to the average impact of stock issues. This is\nwhat Dann and Mikkleson [10] find.\nThese results may make one a bit more comfortable with asymmetric\ninformation models of the kind sketched above, and thus a bit more comfortable\nwith the pecking order story.\nThat's the five facts. Here now are three items that do not qualify for\nthat list--just call then \"observations.\"\nExistence of target ratios. Marsh [21] and Taggart [39] have found some\nevidence that firms adjust towards a target debt-to-value ratio. However, a\nmodel based solely on this partial adj ustment process would have a very low\nR .\nApparently: he static tradeoff model captures only a small part of\nactual behavior. 18\nRisk. Risky firms tend to borrow less, other things equml. For example,\nboth Long and Malitz [20] and Williamson [41] found significant negative\nrelationships between unlevered betas and the level of borrowing. However,\nthe evidence on risk and debt policy is not extensive enough to be totally\nconvincing.\nTaxes. I know of no study clearly demonstrating that a firm's tax status\n19\nhas predictable, material effects on its debt policy.\nI think the wait\nfor such a study will be protracted.\nAdmittedly it's hard to classify firms by tax status without implicitly\nclassifying them on other dimensions as well. For example, firms with large\n-22-\ntax loss carryforwards may also be firms in financial distress, which have\nhigh debt ratios almost by definition. Firms with high operating\nprofitabilt y, and therefore plenty of unshielded income, may also have\nvalt ble intangible assets and growth opportunities. Do they end up with a\nhigher or lower than average debt-to-value ratio? Hard to say.\nConclusion\nPeople feel comfortable with the static tradeoff story because it soinds\nplausible and yields an interior optimum debt ratio.\nIt rationalizes\n\"moderate\" borrowing.\nWell, the story may be moderate and plausible, but that does not make it\nright. We have to ask whether it explains firms' financing behavior. If it\ndoes, fine.\nIf it does not, then we need a better theory before offering\nadvice to managers.\nThe static tradeoff story works to some extent, but it seems to have an\nunacceptably low R .\nActual debt ratios vary widely across apparently\nsimilar firms. Either firms take extended excursions from their targets, or\nthe targets themselves depend on factors not yet recognized or understood.\nAt this point we face a tactical choice between two research strategies.\nFirst, we could try co expand the static tradeoff story by introducing\nadjustment costs, possibly including those stemming from asymmetric\ninformation and agent problems.\nSecond, we could start with a story based on\nasymmetric information, and expand it by adding only those elements of the\nstatic tradeoff which have clear empirical support. I think we will progress\nfarther faster by the latter route.\n-23-\nHere is what I really think is going on. I warn you that the following\n\"modified pecking order\" story is grossly oversimplified and underqu lified.\nBut I think it is generally consistent with the empirical evidence.\n1. Firms have good reasons to avoid having to finance real\ninvestment by issuing common stock or other risky securities. They do not\nwant to run the risk of falling into the dilemma of either passing by\npositive-NPV projects or issuing stock at a price they think is too low.\n2. They set target dividend payout ratios so that normal rates of\nequity investment can be met by internally generated funds.\n3. The firm may also plan to cover part of normal investment outlays\nwith new borrowing, but it tries to restrain itself enough to keep the\ndebt safe--that is, reasonably close to default-risk free. It restrains\nitself for two reasons:\nfirst, to avoid any material costs of financial\ndistress; and second, to maintain financial slack in the form of reserve\nborrowing power. \"Reserve borrowing power\" means that it can issue safe\ndebt if it needs to.\n4. Since target dividend payout ratios are sticky, and investment\nopportunities fluctuate relative to internal cash flow, the firm will from\ntime to time exhaust its ability o issue safe debt. When this happens,\nthe firm turns to less risky securities first--for example, risky debt or\nconvertibles before common stock.\nThe crucial difference between this and the static tradeoff story is that,\nin the modified pecking order story, observed debt ratios will reflect the\ncumulative requirement for external financing--a requirement cumulated over an\nextended period.\nFor example, think of an unusually profitable firm in an\nindustry generating relatively slow growth. That firm will end up with\n-24-\nan unusually low debt ratio compared to its industry's average, and it won't\ndo much of any hing about it.\nIt won't go out of its way to issue debt and\nretire equity to achieve a more normal debt ratio.\nAn unprofitable firm in the same industry will end up with a relatively\nhigh debt ratio.\nIf it is high enough to create significant costs of\nfinancial distress, the firm may rebalance its capital structure by issuing\nequity.\nOn the other hand, it may not. The same asymmetric information\nproblems which sometimes prevent a firm from issuing stock to finance real\ninvestment will sometimes also block issuing stock to retire debt. 21\nIf this story is right, average debt ratios will vary from industry to\nindustry, because asset risk, asse:\nype, and requirements for external funds\nalso vary by industry. But a long-run industry average will not be a\nmeaningful target for individual firms in that industry.\nLet me wrap this up by noting the two clear gaps in my description of\n\"what is really going on.\" First, the modified pecking order story depends on\nsticky dividends, but does not explain why: he are sticky. Second, it leaves\nus with at best a fuzzy understanding of when and why firms issue common\nequity. Unfortunately I have nothing to say on the first weakness, and only\nthe following brief comments on the second.\nThe modified pecking order story recognizes both asymmetric information\nand costs of financial distress. Thus the firm faces two increasing costs as\nit climbs up the pecking order:\nit faces higher odds of incurring costs of\nfinancial distress, and also higher odds that future positive-NPV projects\nwill be passed by because the firm will be unwilling to finance them by\nissuing common stock or other risky securities. The firm m\nchoose to reduce\n-25-\nthese costs by issuing stock now even if new equity is not needed immediately\nto finance real investment, just to move the firm down the pecking order.\nIn\nother words, financial slack (liquid assets or reserve borrowing power) is\nvaluable, and the firm may rationally issue stock to acquire it.\n(I say \"may\"\nbecause the firm which issues equi y to buy financial slack faces the same\nasymmetric information problems as a firm issuing equity to finance real\ninvestment.) The optimal dynamic issue strategy for the firm under asymmetric\ninformation is, as far as I know, totally unexplored territory. 22\n-26-\nFOOTNOTES\n*Sloan School of Management, MIT, and National Bureau of Economic Research.\n1.\nThe finance and economics literature has at least three \"managerial\"\nstrands:\n(1) descriptions of managerial capitalism, in which the\nseparation of ownership and control is taken as a central fact of life,\nfor example Berle and Means [5];\n(2) agencr theory, pioneered for finance\nby Jensen and Meckling [17], and\n(3) the detailed analysis of the\npersonal risks and rewards facing managers and how their responses affect\nfirms' financing or investment choices. For examples of Strand (3), see\nRoss's articles on financial signalling [36,37].\n2.\nPut forward in \"Debt and Taxes,\" [26], esp. pp. 272-273. Note that\nMiller did not claim that all of firms' financing habits are neutral\nmutations, only that some of them may be.\nI doubt that Miller intended\nthis idea as a strict null hypothesis (see below).\n3.\nThe only early cross-sectional study I know of which sidesteps these\nissues is MM's 1966 paper on the cost of capital for the electric utility\nindustry [28].\nTheir \"corrected\" theory says that firm value is\nindependent of capital structure except for the value added by he present\nvalue of interest tax shields. Thus tax-paying firms would be expected to\nsubstitute debt for equity, at least up to the point where the probability\nof financial distress starts to be important. However, the regulated\nfirms MM examined had little tax incentive to use debt, .because their\ninterest tax shields were passed through to consumers.\nIf a regulated\nfirm pays an extra one dollar of interest, and thus saves T\nin\ncorporate income taxes, regulators are supposed to reduce the firm's\n-27-\npre-tax operating income by Tc/(l - Tc),, the grossed-up value of the\ntax saving. This roughly cancels out any taxadvantage of borrowing.\nThus regulated firms sho ld have little incentive to borrow enoagh to\nflirt with financial distress, and their debt ratios could be dispersed\nacross a conservative range.\nMoreover, MM's test could pick up the present value of interest tax\nshields provided they adjusted for differences in operating income.\nRemember, interest tax shields are not eliminated by regulation, just\noffset by reductions in allowed operating income.\nThus regulated firms are relatively good subjects for cross-sectional\ntests of static tradeoff theories. MM's theory seemed to work fairly well\nfor three years in the mid-1950s. Unfortunately, MM's equations didn't\ngive sensible coefficients when fitted on later data (see for example,\nRobichek, McDonald and Higgins [35]).\nThere has been little further work\nattempting to extend or adapt MM's 1966 model. In the meantime, theory\nhas moved on.\n4.\nAlthough Miller's \"Debt and Taxes\" model [26] was a major concepta 1\nstep forward, I do not consider it an adequate description of how taxes\naffect optimum capital structure or expected rates of return on debt and\nequity securities. See Gordon and Malkiel [16] for a recent review of the\nevidence.\n5.\nCordes and Scheffrin [8] present evidence on the cross-sectional\ndispersion of effective corporate tax rates.\n6.\nI have discussed these two points in more detail in [32 and 33].\n-28-\n7.\nIf it is more, the firm first pays off debt or invests in cash or\nmarketable securities. If the surplus persists, it may gradually increase\nits target payout ratio.\n8.\nAlthough I have not seen the term \"pecking order\" used before.\n9.\nThese figures were computed from Brealey and Myers [7], Table 14-3, p. 291.\n10.\nFor example, see Berle [4 ], or Berle and Means [5].\n11.\nIf the firm always has a zero-NPV opportunity available to it, the\ndistrbution of y is truncated at y\n0. I also assume that x is\nnon-negative.\n12.\nThe simple model embodied in (1) and (2) is a direct descendant of\nAkerlof's work [1]. He investigated how markets can fail when buyers can\nnot verify the quality of what they are offered. Faced with the risk of\nbuying a lemon, the buyer will demand a discount, which in turn\ndisco rages the potential sellers who do not have lemons.\nHowever, in\nMajluf's and my model, the seller is offering not a single good, but a\npartial claim on two, the investment project (worth y) and the firm\nwithout the project (worth x).\nThe information asymmetry applies to both\ngoods--for example, the manager may receive inside information that\namounts to good news about x and bad news about y, or vice versa, or\ngood or bad news about both.\nMoreover, the firm may suffer by not selling stock, because the\ninvestment opportunity is lost. Management will sometimes issue even when\nthe stock is undervalued by investors. Consequently, investors on the\nother side of the transaction do not automatically interpret every stock\nissue as an attempted ripoff--if they, did stock would never be issued in\na rational expectations equilibrium.\n-29-\n13.\nThis amounts to assuming that changes in firm value are lognormally\ndistributed, that managers and investors agree on the variance rate, and\nthat managers know the current value of x + y but investors do not. If\nthere is asymmetric information about the variance rate, but not about\nfirm value at the time of issue, the pecking order could be reversed. See\nGiammarino and Neave [15].\n14.\nRegulated firms, particularly electric utilities, typically pay\ndividends generous enough to force regular trips to the equity market.\nThey have a special reason for this polic: it improves their bargaining\nposition vs. consumers and regulators. It turns the opportunity cost of\ncapital into cash requirements.\n15.\nJalilvand and Harris [16], for example.\n16.\nThe problem is not that intangibles and growth opportunities are risky.\nThe securities of growth firms may be excellent collateral. But the firm\nwhich borrows against intangibles or growth opportunities may end up\nreducing their value.\n17.\nThis follows from the simple model presented above. See Myers and\nMajluf [34] for a formal proof.\n18.\nOf course, we could give each firm its own target, and leave that target\nfree to wander over time. But then we would explain everything and know\nnothing. We want a the ry which predicts how debt ratios vary across\nfirms and time.\n19. For example, both Williamson [41] and Long and Malitz [20] introduced\nproxies for firms' tax status, but failed to find any significant,\nindependent effect on debt ratios.\n-30-\n20.\nThe length of that period reflects the time required to make a\nsignificant shift in a target dividend payout ratio.\n21.\nThe factors that make financial distress costly also make it difficult\nto escape. The gain in firm value from rebalancing is highest when the\nfirm has gotten into deep trouble and lenders have absorbed a significant\ncapital loss. In that case, rebalancing gives lenders a windfall gain.\nThis is why firms in financial distress often do not rebalance their\ncapital structures.\n22.\nIf the information assymetry disappears from time to time, then the firm\nclearly should stock up with equity before it reappears. This observation\nis probably not much practical help, however, because we lack an objective\nproxy for changes in the degree of asymmetry.\n__il\u0003\u0003l_\u0003\u0003\n__\nMarket value\nof firm\nFirm value under all-equity financing\nOptimum\nFigure 1.

Introduction\nIn this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey that describes the current\npractice of corporate \"nance. Perhaps the best-known \"eld study in this area is\nJohn Lintner's (1956) path-breaking analysis of dividend policy. The results of\nthat study are still quoted today and have deeply a!ected the way that dividend\npolicy research is conducted. In many respects, our goals are similar to Lin-\ntner's. We hope that researchers will use our results to develop new theories\n} and potentially modify or abandon existing views. We also hope that practi-\ntioners will learn from our analysis by noting how other \"rms operate and by\nidentifying areas where academic recommendations have not been fully imple-\nmented.\nOur survey di!ers from previous surveys in a number of dimensions.\u0002 First,\nthe scope of our survey is broad. We examine capital budgeting, cost of capital,\nand capital structure. This allows us to link responses across areas. For example,\nwe investigate whether \"rms that consider \"nancial #exibility to be a capital\nstructure priority are also likely to value real options in capital budgeting\ndecisions. We explore each category in depth, asking more than 100 total\nquestions.\nSecond, we sample a large cross-section of approximately 4,440 \"rms. In total,\n392 chief \"nancial o$cers responded to the survey, for a response rate of 9%.\nThe next largest survey that we know of is Moore and Reichert (1983) who study\n298 large \"rms. We investigate for possible nonresponse bias and conclude that\nour sample is representative of the population.\n188\nJ.R. Graham, C.R. Harvey / Journal of Financial Economics 60 (2001) 187}243\nThird, we analyze the responses conditional on \"rm characteristics. We\nexamine the relation between the executives' responses and \"rm size, P/E ratio,\nleverage, credit rating, dividend policy, industry, management ownership, CEO\nage, CEO tenure, and the education of the CEO. By testing whether responses\ndi!er across these characteristics, we shed light on the implications of various\ncorporate \"nance theories related to \"rm size, risk, investment opportunities,\ntransaction costs, informational asymmetry, and managerial incentives. This\nanalysis allows for a deeper investigation of corporate \"nance theories. For\nexample, we go beyond asking whether \"rms follow a \"nancial pecking order\n(Myers and Majluf, 1984). We investigate whether the \"rms that most strongly\nsupport the implications of the pecking-order theory are also the \"rms most\na!ected by informational asymmetries, as suggested by the theory.\nSurvey-based analysis complements other research based on large samples\nand clinical studies. Large sample studies are the most common type of empiri-\ncal analysis, and have several advantages over other approaches. Most large-\nsample studies o!er, among other things, statistical power and cross-sectional\nvariation. However, large-sample studies often have weaknesses related to\nvariable speci\"cation and the inability to ask qualitative questions. Clinical\nstudies are less common but o!er excellent detail and are unlikely to `average\nawaya unique aspects of corporate behavior. However, clinical studies use small\nsamples and their results are often sample-speci\"c.\nThe survey approach o!ers a balance between large sample analyses and\nclinical studies. Our survey analysis is based on a moderately large sample and\na broad cross-section of \"rms. At the same time, we are able to ask very speci\"c\nand qualitative questions. The survey approach is not without potential prob-\nlems, however. Surveys measure beliefs and not necessarily actions. Survey\nanalysis faces the risk that the respondents are not representative of the popula-\ntion of \"rms, or that the survey questions are misunderstood. Overall, survey\nanalysis is seldom used in corporate \"nancial research, so we feel that our paper\nprovides unique information to aid our understanding of how \"rms operate.\nThe results of our survey are both reassuring and surprising. On one hand,\nmost \"rms use present value techniques to evaluate new projects. On the other\nhand, a large number of \"rms use company-wide discount rates to evaluate these\nprojects rather than a project-speci\"c discount rate. Interestingly, the survey\nindicates that \"rm size signi\"cantly a!ects the practice of corporate \"nance. For\nexample, large \"rms are signi\"cantly more likely to use net present value\ntechniques and the capital asset pricing model for project evaluation than are\nsmall \"rms, while small \"rms are more likely to use the payback criterion.\nA majority of large \"rms have a tight or somewhat tight target debt ratio, in\ncontrast to only one-third of small \"rms.\nExecutives rely heavily on practical, informal rules when choosing capital\nstructure. The most important factors a!ecting debt policy are \"nancial #exibil-\nity and a good credit rating. When issuing equity, respondents are concerned\nJ.R. Graham, C.R. Harvey / Journal of Financial Economics 60 (2001) 187}243\n189\nabout earnings per share dilution and recent stock price appreciation. We \"nd\nvery little evidence that executives are concerned about asset substitution,\nasymmetric information, transactions costs, free cash #ows, or personal taxes.\nWe acknowledge but do not investigate the possibility that these deeper implica-\ntions are, for example, impounded into prices and credit ratings, and so execu-\ntives react to them indirectly.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In the second section, we present the survey\ndesign, the sampling methodology, and discuss some caveats of survey research.\nIn the third section we study capital budgeting. We analyze the cost of capital in\nthe fourth section. In the \"fth section we examine capital structure. We o!er\nsome concluding remarks in the \"nal section.\n2. Methodology\n2.1. Design\nOur survey focuses on three areas: capital budgeting, cost of capital, and\ncapital structure. Based on a careful review of the existing literature, we de-\nveloped a draft survey that was circulated to a group of prominent academics for\nfeedback. We incorporated their suggestions and revised the survey. We then\nsought the advice of marketing research experts on the survey design and\nexecution. We made changes to the format of the questions and overall survey\ndesign with the goal of minimizing biases induced by the questionnaire and\nmaximizing the response rate.\nThe survey project is a joint e!ort with the Financial Executives Institute\n(FEI). FEI has approximately 14,000 members that hold policy-making posi-\ntions as CFOs, treasurers, and controllers at 8,000 companies throughout the\nU.S. and Canada. Every quarter, Duke University and the FEI poll these\n\"nancial o$cers with a one-page survey on important topical issues (Graham,\n1999b). The usual response rate for the quarterly survey is 8}10%.\nUsing the penultimate version of the survey, we conducted beta tests at both\nFEI and Duke University. This involved having graduating MBA students and\n\"nancial executives \"ll out the survey, note the required time, and provide\nfeedback. Our beta testers took, on average, 17 minutes to complete the survey.\nBased on this and other feedback, we made \"nal changes to the wording on\nsome questions. The \"nal version of the survey contained 15 questions, most\nwith subparts, and was three pages long. One section collected demographic\ninformation about the sample \"rms.\nThe\nsurvey\ninstrument\nappears\non\nthe\nInternet\nat\nthe\naddress\nhttp://www.duke.edu/&charvey/Research/indexr.htm. We sent out two di!er-\nent versions with questions 11}14 and questions 1}4 interchanged. We were\nconcerned that the respondents might \"ll in the \"rst page or two of the survey\n190\nJ.R. Graham, C.R. Harvey / Journal of Financial Economics 60 (2001) 187}243\nbut leave the last page blank. If this were the case, we would expect to see\na higher proportion of respondents answering the questions that appear at the\nbeginning of either version of the survey. We \"nd no evidence that the response\nrate di!ers depending on whether the questions are at beginning or the end of\nthe survey.\n2.2. Delivery and response\nWe used two mechanisms to deliver the survey. We sent a mailing from Duke\nUniversity on February 10, 1999 to each CFO in the 1998 Fortune 500 list.\nIndependently, the FEI faxed out 4,440 surveys to their member \"rms on\nFebruary 16, 1999. Three hundred thirteen of the Fortune 500 CFOs belong to\nthe FEI, so these \"rms received both a fax and a mailed version. We requested\nthat the surveys be returned by February 23, 1999. To encourage the executives\nto respond, we o!ered an advanced copy of the results to interested parties.\nWe employed a team of 10 MBA students to follow up on the mailing to the\nFortune 500 \"rms with a phone call and possible faxing of a second copy of the\nsurvey. On February 23, FEI refaxed the survey to the 4,440 FEI corporations\nand we remailed the survey to the Fortune 500 \"rms, with a new due date of\nFebruary 26, 1999. This second stage was planned in advance and designed to\nmaximize the response rate.\nThe executives returned their completed surveys by fax to a third-party data\nvendor. Using a third party ensures that the survey responses are anonymous.\nWe feel that anonymity is important to obtain frank answers to some of the\nquestions. Although we do not know the identity of the survey respondents, we\ndo know a number of \"rm-speci\"c characteristics, as discussed below.\nThree hundred ninety-two completed surveys were returned, for a response\nrate of nearly 9%. Given the length (three pages) and depth (over 100 questions)\nof our survey, this response rate compares favorably to the response rate for the\nquarterly FEI-Duke survey.The rate is also comparable to other recent aca-\ndemic surveys. For example, Trahan and Gitman (1995) obtain a 12% response\nrate in a survey mailed to 700 CFOs. The response rate is higher (34%) in Block\n(1999), but he targets Chartered Financial Analysts - not senior o$cers of\nparticular \"rms.\n2.3. Summary statistics and data issues\nFig. 1 presents summary information about the \"rms in our sample. The\ncompanies range from very small (26% of the sample \"rms have sales of less\nthan $100 million) to very large (42% have sales of at least $1 billion) (see Fig.\n1A). In subsequent analysis, we refer to \"rms with revenues greater than $1\nbillion as `largea. Forty percent of the \"rms are manufacturers (Fig. 1C). The\nnonmanufacturing \"rms are evenly spread across other industries, including\nJ.R. Graham, C.R. Harvey / Journal of Financial Economics 60 (2001) 187}243\n191\nFig. 1. Sample characterstics based on the survey respponses of 392 CFOs.\n\"nancial (15%), transportation and energy (13%), retail and wholesale sales\n(11%), and high-tech (9%). In the appendix, we show that the responding \"rms\nare representative of the corporate population for size, industry, and other\ncharacteristics.\nThe median price}earnings ratio is 15. Sixty percent of the respondents have\nprice}earnings ratios of 15 or greater (Fig. 1D). We refer to these \"rms as growth\n192\nJ.R. Graham, C.R. Harvey / Journal of Financial Economics 60 (2001) 187}243\nFig. 1. (continued).\n\"rms when we analyze how investment opportunities a!ect corporate behavior.\nWe refer to the remaining 40% of the respondents as nongrowth \"rms.\nThe distribution of debt levels is fairly uniform (Fig. 1E). Approximately\none-third of the sample \"rms have debt-to-asset ratios below 20%, another third\nhave debt ratios between 20% and 40%, and the remaining \"rms have debt\nratios greater than 40%. We refer to \"rms with debt ratios greater than 30% as\nJ.R. Graham, C.R. Harvey / Journal of Financial Economics 60 (2001) 187}243\n193\nhighly levered. The creditworthiness of the sample is also dispersed (Fig. 1F).\nTwenty percent of the companies have credit ratings of AA or AAA, 32% have\nan A credit rating, and 27% have a BBB rating. The remaining 21% have\nspeculative debt with ratings of BB or lower.\nThough our survey respondents are CFOs, we ask a number of questions\nabout the characteristics of the chief executive o$cers. We assume that the\nCFOs act as agents for the CEOs. Nearly half of the CEOs for the responding\n\"rms are between 50 and 59 years old (Fig. 1I). Another 23% are over age 59,\na group we refer to as `mature.a Twenty-eight percent of the CEOs are between\nthe ages of 40 and 49. The survey reveals that executives change jobs frequently.\nNearly 40% of the CEOs have been in their jobs less than four years, and\nanother 26% have been in their jobs between four and nine years (Fig. 1J). We\nde\"ne the 34% who have been in their jobs longer than nine years as having\n`long tenurea. Forty-one percent of the CEOs have an undergraduate degree as\ntheir highest level of educational attainment (Fig. 1K). Another 38% have an\nMBA and 8% have a non-MBA masters degree. Finally, the top three executives\nown at least 5% of the common stock of their \"rm in 44% of the sample. These\nCEO characteristics allow us to examine whether managerial incentives or\nentrenchment a!ect the survey responses. We also study whether having an\nMBA a!ects the choices made by corporate executives.\nFig. 1M shows that 36% of the sample \"rms seriously considered issuing\ncommon equity, 20% considered issuing convertible debt, and 31% thought\nabout issuing debt in foreign markets. Among responding \"rms, 64% calculate\nthe cost of equity, 63% have publicly traded common stock, 53% issue divi-\ndends, and 7% are regulated utilities (Fig. 1N). If issuing dividends is an\nindication of a reduced informational disadvantage for investors relative to\nmanagers (Sharpe and Nguyen, 1995), the dividend issuance dichotomy allows\nus to examine whether the data support corporate theories based on informa-\ntional asymmetry.\nTable 1 presents correlations for the demographic variables. Not surprisingly,\nsmall companies have lower credit ratings, a higher proportion of management\nownership, a lower incidence of paying dividends, a higher chance of being\nprivately owned, and a lower proportion of foreign revenue. Growth \"rms are\nlikely to be small, have lower credit ratings, and have a higher degree of\nmanagement ownership. Firms that do not pay dividends have low credit\nratings.\nBelow, we perform univariate analyses on the survey responses conditional on\neach separate \"rm characteristic. However, because size is correlated with\na number of di!erent factors, we perform a robustness check for the nonsize\ncharacteristics. We split the sample into large \"rms versus small \"rms. On each\nsize subsample, we repeat the analysis of the responses conditional on \"rm\ncharacteristics other than size. We generally only report the \"ndings with\nrespect to nonsize characteristics if they hold on the full sample and the two size\n194\nJ.R. Graham, C.R. Harvey / Journal of Financial Economics 60 (2001) 187}243\nJ.R. Graham, C.R. Harvey / Journal of Financial Economics 60 (2001) 187}243\n195\nsubsamples. We also perform a separate robustness check relative to public\nversus private \"rms and only report the characteristic-based results if they hold\nfor the full and public samples. The tables contain the full set of results, including\nthose that do not pass these robustness checks.\nAll in all, the variation in executive and \"rm characteristics permits a rich\ndescription of the practice of corporate \"nance, and allows us to infer whether\ncorporate actions are consistent with academic theories. We show in the appen-\ndix that our sample is representative of the population from which it was drawn,\nfairly representative of Compustat \"rms, and not adversely a!ected by non-\nresponse bias.\n3. Capital budgeting methods\n3.1. Design\nThis section studies how \"rms evaluate projects. Previous surveys mainly\nfocus on large \"rms and suggest that internal rate of return (IRR) is the primary\nmethod for evaluation. For example, Gitman and Forrester (1977), in their\nsurvey of 103 large \"rms, \"nd that only 9.8% of \"rms use net present value as\ntheir primary method and 53.6% report IRR as primary method. Stanley and\nBlock (1984) \"nd that 65% of respondents report IRR as their primary capital\nbudgeting technique. Moore and Reichert (1983) survey 298 Fortune 500 \"rms\nand \"nd that 86% use some type of discounted cash #ow analysis. Bierman\n(1993) \"nds that 73 of 74 Fortune 100 \"rms use some type of discounted cash\n#ow analysis. These results are similar to the \"ndings in Trahan and Gitman\n(1995), who survey 84 Fortune 500 and Forbes 200 best small companies, and\nBruner et al. (1998), who interview 27 highly regarded corporations. (See\nhttp://www.duke.edu/&charvey/Research/indexr.htmfor a review of the capital\nbudgeting literature.)\nOur survey di!ers from previous work in several ways. The most obvious\ndi!erence is that previous work almost exclusively focuses on the largest \"rms.\nSecond, given that our sample is larger than all previous surveys, we are able to\ncontrol for many di!erent \"rm characteristics. Finally, we go beyond NPV\nversus IRR analysis and ask whether \"rms use the following evaluation tech-\nniques: adjusted present value (see Brealey and Myers, 1996), payback period,\ndiscounted payback period, pro\"tability index, and accounting rate of return.\nWe also inquire whether \"rms bypass discounting techniques and simply use\nearnings multiples. A price-earnings approach can be thought of as measuring\nthe number of years it takes for the stock price to be paid for by earnings, and\ntherefore can be interpreted as a version of the payback method. We are also\ninterested in whether \"rms use other types of analyses that are taught in many\nMBA programs, such as simulation analysis and value at risk (VaR). Finally, we\n196\nJ.R. Graham, C.R.

We report the\npercentage of CFOs who always or almost always use a particular technique. IRR represents\ninternal rate of return, NPV is net present value, P/E is the price-to-earnings ratio, and APV is\nadjusted present value. The survey is based on the responses of 392 CFOs.\nare interested in the importance of real options in project evaluation (see Myers,\n1977).\n3.2. Results\nRespondents are asked to score how frequently they use the di!erent capital\nbudgeting techniques on a scale of 0 to 4 (0 meaning `nevera, 4 meaning\n`alwaysa). In many respects, the results di!er from previous surveys, perhaps\nbecause we have a more diverse sample. An important caveat here, and through-\nout the survey, is that the responses represent beliefs. We have no way of\nverifying that the beliefs coincide with actions.\nMost respondents select net present value and internal rate of return as their\nmost frequently used capital budgeting techniques (see Table 2); 74.9% of CFOs\nalways or almost always (responses of 4 and 3) use net present value (rating of\n3.08); and 75.7% always or almost always use internal rate of return (rating of\n3.09). The hurdle rate is also popular. These results are summarized in Fig. 2.\nThe most interesting results come from examining the responses conditional\non \"rm and executive characteristics. Large \"rms are signi\"cantly more likely to\nuse NPV than small \"rms (rating of 3.42 versus 2.83). There is no di!erence in\ntechniques used by growth and nongrowth \"rms. Highly levered \"rms are\nsigni\"cantly more likely to use NPV and IRR than are \"rms with small debt\nJ.R. Graham, C.R.

In unreported analysis, we \"nd\na signi\"cant di!erence between high- and low-leverage small \"rms as well as\nhigh- and low-leverage large \"rms. Interestingly, highly levered \"rms are also\nmore likely to use sensitivity and simulation analysis. Perhaps because of\nregulatory requirements, utilities are more likely to use IRR and NPV and\nperform sensitivity and simulation analyses. We also \"nd that CEOs with MBAs\nare more likely than non-MBA CEOs to use net present value, but the di!erence\nis only signi\"cant at the 10% level.\nFirms that pay dividends are signi\"cantly more likely to use NPV and IRR\nthan are \"rms that do not pay dividends. This result is also robust to our analysis by\nsize. Public companies are signi\"cantly more likely to use NPV and IRR than are\nprivate corporations. As the correlation analysis indicates in Table 1, many of these\nattributes are correlated. For example, private corporations are also smaller \"rms.\nOther than NPV and IRR, the payback period is the most frequently used\ncapital budgeting technique (rating of 2.53). This is surprising because \"nancial\ntextbooks have lamented the shortcomings of the payback criterion for decades.\n(Payback ignores the time value of money and cash #ows beyond the cuto! date;\nthe cuto! is usually arbitrary.) Small \"rms use the payback period (rating of\n2.72) almost as frequently as they use NPV or IRR. In untabulated analysis, we\n\"nd that among small \"rms, CEOs without MBAs are more likely to use the\npayback criterion. The payback is most popular among mature CEOs (rating of\n2.83). In separate examinations of small and large \"rms, we \"nd that mature\nCEOs use payback signi\"cantly more often than younger CEOs. Payback is\nalso frequently used by CEOs with long tenure (rating of 2.80). Few \"rms use the\ndiscounted payback (rating of 1.56), a method that eliminates one of the payback\ncriterion's de\"ciencies by accounting for the time value of money.\nIt is sometimes argued that the payback approach is rational for severely\ncapital constrained \"rms: if an investment project does not pay positive cash\n#ows early on, the \"rm will cease operations and therefore not receive positive\ncash #ows that occur in the distant future, or else will not have the resources to\npursue other investments during the next few years (Weston and Brigham, 1981,\np. 405). We do not \"nd any evidence to support this claim because we \"nd no\nrelation between the use of payback and leverage, credit ratings, or dividend\npolicy. Our \"nding that payback is used by older, longer-tenure CEOs without\nMBAs instead suggests that lack of sophistication is a driving factor behind the\npopularity of the payback criterion.\nMcDonald (1998) notes that rules of thumb such as payback and hurdle rates\ncan approximate optimal decision rules that account for the option-like features\nof many investments, especially in the evaluation of very uncertain investments.\nIf small \"rms have more volatile projects than do large \"rms, this could explain\nwhy small \"rms use these ad hoc decision rules. It is even possible that small\n\"rms use these rules not because they realize that they approximate the optimal\nrule but simply because the rules have worked in the past.\n200\nJ.R. Graham, C.R. Harvey / Journal of Financial Economics 60 (2001) 187}243\nA number of \"rms use the earnings multiple approach for project evaluation.\nThere is weak evidence that large \"rms are more likely to employ this approach\nthan are small \"rms. We \"nd that a \"rm is signi\"cantly more likely to use\nearnings multiples if it is highly levered. The in#uence of leverage on the\nearnings multiple approach is also robust across size (i.e., highly levered \"rms,\nwhether they are large or small, frequently use earnings multiples).\nIn summary, compared to previous research, our results suggest increased\nprominence of net present value as an evaluation technique. In addition, the\nlikelihood of using speci\"c evaluation techniques is linked to \"rm size, \"rm\nleverage, and CEO characteristics. In particular, small \"rms are signi\"cantly\nless likely to use net present value. They are also less likely to use supple-\nmentary sensitivity and VaR analyses. The next section takes this analysis one\nstep further by detailing the speci\"c methods \"rms use to obtain the cost of\ncapital, the most important risk factors, and a speci\"c capital budgeting\nscenario.\n4. Cost of capital\n4.1. Methodology\nOur \"rst task is to determine how \"rms calculate the cost of equity capital.\nWe explore whether \"rms use the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), a multi-\nbeta CAPM (with extra risk factors in addition to the market beta), average\nhistorical returns, or a dividend discount model. The results in Table 3 and\nsummarized in Fig. 3 indicate that the CAPM is by far the most popular method\nof estimating the cost of equity capital: 73.5% of respondents always or almost\nalways use the CAPM (rating of 2.92; see also Fig. 1H). The second and third\nmost popular methods are average stock returns and a multibeta CAPM,\nrespectively. Few \"rms back the cost of equity out from a dividend discount\nmodel (rating of 0.91). This sharply contrasts with the \"ndings of Gitman\nand Mercurio (1982) who survey 177 Fortune 1000 \"rms and \"nd that\nonly 29.9% of respondents use the CAPM `in some fashiona but \"nd that\n31.2% of the participants in their survey use a version of the dividend discount\nmodel to establish their cost of capital. More recently, Bruner et al. (1998)\n\"nd that 85% of their 27 best-practice \"rms use the CAPM or a modi\"ed\nCAPM. While the CAPM is popular, we show later that it is not clear that\nthe model is applied properly in practice. Of course, even if it is applied pro-\nperly, it is not clear that the CAPM is a very good model (see Fama and French,\n1992).\nThe cross-sectional analysis is particularly illuminating. Large \"rms are much\nmore likely to use the CAPM than are small \"rms (rating of 3.27 versus 2.49,\nrespectively). Smaller \"rms are more inclined to use a cost of equity capital that\nJ.R.

Survey evidence on the popularity of di!erent methods of calculat the cost of equity capital.\nWe report the percentage of CFOs who always or almost always use a particular technique. CAPM\nrepresents the capital asset pricing model. The survey is based on the responses of 392 CFOs.\nis determined by `what investors tell us they requirea. CEOs with MBAs are\nmore likely to use the single-factor CAPM or the CAPM with extra risk factors\nthan are non-MBA CEOs, but the di!erence is only signi\"cant for the single-\nfactor CAPM.\nWe also \"nd that \"rms with low leverage or small management ownership are\nsigni\"cantly more likely to use the CAPM. We \"nd signi\"cant di!erences for\nprivate versus public \"rms (public more likely to use the CAPM). This is perhaps\nexpected given that the beta of the private \"rm could only be calculated via\nanalysis of comparable publicly traded \"rms. Finally, we \"nd that \"rms with\nhigh foreign sales are more likely to use the CAPM.\nGiven the sharp di!erence between large and small \"rms, it is important to\ncheck whether some of these control e!ects just proxy for size. It is, indeed, the\ncase that foreign sales proxy for size. Table 1 shows that that there is a signi\"-\ncant correlation between percent of foreign sales and size. When we analyze the\nuse of the CAPM by foreign sales controlling for size, we \"nd no signi\"cant\ndi!erences. However, this is not true for some of the other control variables.\nThere is a signi\"cant di!erence in use of the CAPM across leverage that is\nrobust to size. The public/private e!ect is also robust to size. Finally, the\ndi!erence in the use of the CAPM based on management ownership holds for\nsmall \"rms but not for large \"rms. That is, among small \"rms, CAPM use is\ninversely related to managerial ownership. There is no signi\"cant relation for\nlarger \"rms.\nJ.R. Graham, C.R. Harvey / Journal of Financial Economics 60 (2001) 187}243\n203\n4.2. Specixc risk factors\nTable 4 investigates sources of risk other than market risk, and how they are\ntreated in project evaluation. The list of risk factors includes the fundamental\nfactors in Fama and French (1992), and momentum as de\"ned in Jegadeesh and\nTitman (1993), as well as the macroeconomic factors in Chen et al. (1986) and\nFerson and Harvey (1991).\nThe format of Table 4 is di!erent from the others. We ask whether, in\nresponse to these risk factors, the \"rm modi\"es its discount rate, cash #ows,\nboth, or neither. We report the percentage of respondents for each category. In\nthe cross-tabulations across each of the demographic factors, we test whether\nthe `neithera category is signi\"cantly di!erent conditional on \"rm character-\nistics.\nOverall, the most important additional risk factors are interest rate risk,\nexchange rate risk, business cycle risk, and in#ation risk (see Fig. 4). For the\ncalculation of discount rates, the most important factors are interest rate risk,\nsize, in#ation risk, and foreign exchange rate risk. For the calculation of cash\n#ows, many \"rms incorporate the e!ects of commodity prices, GDP growth,\nin#ation, and foreign exchange risk.\nInterestingly, few \"rms adjust either discount rates or cash #ows for book-to-\nmarket, distress, or momentum risks. Only 13.1% of respondents consider the\nbook-to-market ratio in either the cash #ow or discount rate calculations.\nMomentum is only considered important by 11.1% of the respondents.\nSmall and large \"rms have di!erent priorities when adjusting for risk. For\nlarge \"rms, the most important risk factors (in addition to market risk) are\nforeign exchange risk, business cycle risk, commodity price risk, and interest rate\nrisk. This closely corresponds to the set of factors detailed in Ferson and Harvey\n(1993) in their large-sample study of multibeta international asset pricing mod-\nels. Ferson and Harvey \"nd that the most important additional factor is foreign\nexchange risk. Table 4 shows that foreign exchange risk is by far the most\nimportant nonmarket risk factor for large \"rms (61.7% of the large \"rms adjust\nfor foreign exchange risk; the next closest is 51.4% adjusting for business cycle\nrisk).\nThe ordering is di!erent for small \"rms. Small \"rms are more a!ected by\ninterest rate risk than they are by foreign exchange risk. This asymmetry in risk\nexposure is consistent with the analysis of Jagannathan and Wang (1996) and\nJagannathan et al. (1998). They argue that small \"rms are more likely to be\nexposed to labor income risk and, as a result, we should expect to \"nd these\n\"rms relying on a di!erent set of risk factors, and using the CAPM less\nfrequently, when estimating their cost of capital.\nAs might be expected, \"rms with considerable foreign sales are sensitive to\nunexpected exchange rate #uctuations. Fourteen percent of \"rms with substan-\ntial foreign exposure adjust discount rates for foreign exchange risk, 22% adjust\n204\nJ.R. Graham, C.R.

These \"gures represent the highest incidence of\n`adjusting somethinga for any type of non-market risk, for any demographic.\nThere are some interesting observations for the other control variables.\nHighly levered \"rms are more likely to consider business cycle risk important;\nsurprisingly, however, indebtedness does not a!ect whether \"rms adjust for\ninterest rate risk, term structure risk, or distress risk. Growth \"rms are much\nmore sensitive to foreign exchange risk than are nongrowth \"rms. (Table 4 only\nreports the results for four control variables; A full version of Table 4 is available\non the Internet at http://www.duke.edu/&charvey/Research/indexr.htm.)\n4.3. Project versus xrm risk\nFinally, we explore how the cost of equity models are used. In particular, we\nconsider an example of how a \"rm evaluates a new project in an overseas\nmarket. We are most interested in whether corporations consider the company-\nwide risk or the project risk in evaluating the project.\nTable 5 contains some surprising results. Remarkably, most \"rms would use\na single company-wide discount rate to evaluate the project; 58.8% of the\nrespondents would always or almost always use the company-wide discount\nrate, even though the hypothetical project would most likely have di!erent risk\ncharacteristics. However, 51% of the \"rms said they would always or almost\nJ.R. Graham, C.R.

These results\nare related to Bierman (1993) who \"nds that 93% of the Fortune 100 industrial\n\"rms use the company-wide weighted average cost of capital for discounting,\n72% use the rate applicable to the project based on the risk or the nature of the\nproject, and 35% use a rate based on the division's risk.\nThe reliance of many \"rms on a company-wide discount rate might make\nsense if these same \"rms adjust cash #ows for foreign exchange risk when\nconsidering risk factors (i.e., in Table 4). However in untabulated results, we \"nd\nthe opposite: \"rms that do not adjust cash #ows for foreign exchange risk are\nalso relatively less likely (compared to \"rms that adjust for foreign exchange\nrisk) to use a risk-matched discount rate when evaluating an overseas project.\nLarge \"rms are signi\"cantly more likely to use the risk-matched discount rate\nthan are small \"rms (rating of 2.34 versus 1.86). This is also con\"rmed in our\nanalysis of Fortune 500 \"rms, which are much more likely to use the risk-\nmatched discount rate than the \"rm-wide discount rate to evaluate the foreign\nproject (rating of 2.61 versus 1.97). Very few \"rms use a di!erent discount rate to\nseparately value di!erent cash #ows within the same project (rating of 0.66), as\nBrealey and Myers (1996) suggest they should for cash #ows such as depreciation.\nThe analysis across \"rm characteristics reveals some interesting patterns.\nGrowth \"rms are more likely to use a company-wide discount rate to evaluate\nprojects. Surprisingly, \"rms with foreign exposure are signi\"cantly more likely\nto use the company-wide discount rate to value an overseas project. Public\ncorporations are more likely to use a risk-matched discount rate than are\nprivate corporations; however, this result is not robust to controlling for size.\nCEOs with short tenures are more likely to use a company-wide discount rate\n(signi\"cant at the 5% level for both large and small \"rms).\n5. Capital structure\nOur survey has separate questions about debt, equity, debt maturity, convert-\nible debt, foreign debt, target debt ratios, credit ratings, and actual debt ratios.\nInstead of stepping through the responses security by security, this section\ndistills the most important \"ndings from the capital structure questions and\npresents the results grouped by theoretical hypothesis or concept. These group-\nings are neither mutually exclusive nor all-encompassing; they are intended\nprimarily to organize the exposition.\n5.1. Trade-ow theory of capital structure choice\n5.1.1. Target debt ratios and the costs and benexts of debt\nOne of the longest-standing questions about capital structure is whether \"rms\nhave target debt ratios. The trade-o! theory says that \"rms have optimal\nJ.R. Graham, C.R. Harvey / Journal of Financial Economics 60 (2001) 187}243\n209\nFig. 5. Survey evidence on some of the factors that a!ect the decision to issue debt. The survey is\nbased on the responses of 392 CFOs.\ndebt}equity ratios, which they determine by trading o! the bene\"ts of debt with\nthe costs (e.g., Scott, 1976). In traditional trade-o! models, the chief bene\"t of\ndebt is the tax advantage of interest deductibility (Modigliani and Miller, 1963).\nThe primary costs are those associated with \"nancial distress and the personal\ntax expense bondholders incur when they receive interest income (Miller, 1977).\nIn this section we discuss the traditional factors in the trade-o! theory, namely\ndistress costs and tax costs and bene\"ts. Many additional factors (e.g., informa-\ntional asymmetry, agency costs) can be modeled in a trade-o! framework. We\ndiscuss these alternative costs and bene\"ts in separate sections below.\nTable 6 and Fig. 5 show the factors that determine the appropriate amount of\ndebt for the \"rm. The CFOs tell us that the corporate tax advantage of debt is\nmoderately important in capital structure decisions: Row a of Table 6 shows\nthat the mean response is 2.07 on a scale from 0 to 4 (0 meaning not important, 4\nmeaning very important). The tax advantage is most important for large,\nregulated, and dividend-paying \"rms } companies that probably have high\ncorporate tax rates and therefore large tax incentives to use debt. Desai (1998)\nshows that \"rms issue foreign debt in response to relative tax incentives, so we\ninvestigate whether \"rms issue debt when foreign tax treatment is favorable. We\n\"nd that favorable foreign tax treatment relative to the U.S. is fairly important\n(overall rating of 2.26 in Table 7). Big \"rms (2.41) with large foreign exposure\n(2.50) are relatively likely to indicate that foreign tax treatment is an important\n210\nJ.R. Graham, C.R. Harvey / Journal of Financial Economics 60 (2001) 187}243\nfactor. This could indicate that \"rms need a certain level of sophistication and\nexposure to perform international tax planning.\nIn contrast, we \"nd very little evidence that \"rms directly consider personal\ntaxes when deciding on debt policy (rating of 0.68 in Table 6) or equity policy\n(rating of 0.82 in Table 8, the least popular equity issuance factor). Therefore, it\nseems unlikely that \"rms target investors in certain tax clienteles (although we\ncan not rule out the possibility that investors choose to invest in \"rms based on\npayout policy, or that executives respond to personal tax considerations to the\nextent that they are re#ected in market prices, see Graham, 1999a).\nWhen we ask \"rms directly about whether potential costs of distress a!ect\ntheir debt decisions, we \"nd they are not very important (rating of 1.24 in\nTable 6), although they are relatively important among speculative-grade \"rms.\nHowever, \"rms are very concerned about their credit ratings (rating of 2.46, the\nsecond most important debt factor), which can be viewed as an indication of\nconcern about distress. Among utilities and \"rms that have rated debt, credit\nratings are a very important determinant of debt policy. Credit ratings are also\nimportant for large \"rms (3.14) that are in the Fortune 500 (3.31). Finally, CFOs\nare also concerned about earnings volatility when making debt decisions (rating\nof 2.32), which is consistent with the trade-o! theory's prediction that \"rms\nreduce debt usage when the probability of bankruptcy is high (Castanias, 1983).\nWe ask directly whether \"rms have an optimal or `targeta debt}equity ratio.\nNineteen percent of the \"rms do not have a target debt ratio or target range (see\nFig. 1G). Another 37% have a #exible target, and 34% have a somewhat tight\ntarget or range. The remaining 10% have a strict target debt ratio (see Fig. 6).\nThese overall numbers provide mixed support for the notion that companies\ntrade o! costs and bene\"ts to derive an optimal debt ratio. However, un-\ntabulated analysis shows that large \"rms are more likely to have target debt\nratios: 55% of large \"rms have at least somewhat strict target ratios, compared\nto 36% of small \"rms. Targets that are tight or somewhat strict are more\ncommon among investment-grade (64%) than speculative \"rms (41%), and\namong regulated (67%) than unregulated \"rms (43%). Targets are important if\nthe CEO has short tenure or is young, and when the top three o$cers own less\nthan 5% of the \"rm.\nFinally, the CFOs tell us that their companies issue equity to maintain\na target debt}equity ratio (rating of 2.26; Row e of Table 8), especially if their\n\"rm is highly levered (2.68), \"rm ownership is widely dispersed (2.64), or the\nCEO is young (2.41). Overall, the survey evidence provides moderate support for\nthe trade-o! theory.\n5.1.2. Deviations from target debt ratios\nActual debt ratios vary across \"rms and through time.

Harvey / Journal of Financial Economics 60 (2001) 187}243\nevidence supports this hypothesis: the mean response of 1.08 indicates that \"rms\ndo not rebalance in response to market equity movements (Row g in Table 9).\nFurther, among \"rms targeting their debt ratio, few \"rms (rating of 0.99) state\nthat changes in the price of equity a!ect their debt policy. Similarly, in their\nlarge-sample study of Compustat \"rms, Opler and Titman (1998) \"nd that \"rms\nissue equity after stock price increases, which they note is inconsistent with \"rms\ntargeting debt ratios because it moves them further from any such target.\nFisher et al. (1989) propose an alternative explanation of why debt ratios vary\nover time, even if \"rms have a target. If there are \"xed transactions costs to\nissuing or retiring debt, a \"rm only rebalances when its debt ratio crosses an\nupper or lower hurdle. We \"nd moderate evidence that \"rms consider transac-\ntions costs when making debt issuance decisions (rating of 1.95 in Row e of\nTable 6), especially among small \"rms (2.07) in which the CEO has been in o$ce\nfor at least ten years (2.22). Many papers (e.g., Titman and Wessels, 1988)\ninterpret the \"nding that small \"rms use relatively little debt as evidence that\ntransaction costs discourage debt usage among small \"rms; as far as we know,\nour analysis is the most direct examination of this hypothesis to date. However,\nwhen we ask whether they delay issuing debt (rating of 1.06 in Table 9) or\nretiring debt (1.04) because of transactions costs, which is a more direct test of\nthe Fisher et al. (1989) hypothesis, the support for the transactions cost hypothe-\nsis is weak.\n5.2. Asymmetric information explanations of capital structure\n5.2.1. Pecking-order model of xnancing hierarchy\nThe pecking-order model of \"nancing choice assumes that \"rms do not target\na speci\"c debt ratio, but instead use external \"nancing only when internal funds\nare insu$cient. External funds are less desirable because informational asym-\nmetries between management and investors imply that external funds are\nundervalued in relation to the degree of asymmetry (Myers and Majluf, 1984;\nMyers, 1984). Therefore, if \"rms use external funds, they prefer to use debt,\nconvertible securities, and, as a last resort, equity.\nMyers and Majluf (1984) assume that \"rms seek to maintain \"nancial slack to\navoid the need for external funds. Therefore, if we \"nd that \"rms value \"nancial\n#exibility, this is generally consistent with the pecking-order theory. However,\n#exibility is also important for reasons unrelated to the pecking-order model\n(e.g., Opler et al., 1999), so \"nding that CFOs value \"nancial #exibility is not\nsu$cient to prove that the pecking-order model is the true description of capital\nstructure choice.\nWe ask several questions related to the pecking-order model. We ask if \"rms\nissue securities when internal funds are not su$cient to fund their activities, and\nseparately ask if equity is used when debt, convertibles, or other sources of\n\"nancing are not available. We also inquire whether executives consider equity\nJ.R. Graham, C.R.

Survey evidence on whether \"rms have optimal or target debt}equity ratios. The survey is\nbased on the responses of 392 CFOs.\n\u0003 Pinegar and Wilbricht (1989) survey 176 unregulated, non\"nancial Fortune 500 \"rms. Like us,\nthey \"nd that #exibility is the most important factor a!ecting \"nancing decisions, and that\nbankruptcy costs and personal tax considerations are among the least important. Our analysis,\nexamining a broader cross-section of theoretical hypotheses and using information on \"rm and\nexecutive characteristics, shows that the relative importance of these factors is robust to a more\ngeneral survey design.\nundervaluation when deciding which security to use, and whether \"nancial\n#exibility is important.\nThe most important item a!ecting corporate debt decisions is management's\ndesire for `\"nancial #exibility,a with a mean rating of 2.59 (Table 6).\u0003 Four \"rms\nwrite in explicitly that they remain #exible in the sense of minimizing interest\nobligations, so that they do not need to shrink their business in case of an\neconomic downturn. In untabulated analysis, we \"nd that \"rms that value\n\"nancial #exibility are more likely to value real options in project evaluation,\nbut the di!erence is not signi\"cant. Fifty-nine percent of the respondents say\nthat #exibility is important (rating of 3) or very important (rating of 4). This\n\"nding is interesting because Graham (2000) shows that \"rms use their \"nancial\n#exibility (i.e., preserve debt capacity) to make future expansions and acquisi-\ntions, but they appear to retain a lot of unused #exibility even after expanding.\nHowever, the importance of #exibility in the survey responses is not related to\ninformational asymmetry (size or dividend payout) or growth options in the\nmanner suggested by the pecking-order theory. In fact, #exibility is statistically\n218\nJ.R. Graham, C.R. Harvey / Journal of Financial Economics 60 (2001) 187}243\nmore important for dividend-paying \"rms, opposite the theoretical prediction (if\ndividend-paying \"rms have relatively little informational asymmetry). There-\nfore, a deeper investigation indicates that the desire for \"nancial #exibility is not\ndriven by the factors behind the pecking-order theory.\nHaving insu$cient internal funds is a moderately important in#uence on the\ndecision to issue debt (rating of 2.13, Row a in Table 9). This behavior is\ngenerally consistent with the pecking-order model. More small \"rms (rating of\n2.30) than large \"rms (1.88) indicate that they use debt in the face of insu$cient\ninternal funds, which is consistent with the pecking-order if small \"rms su!er\nfrom larger asymmetric-information-related equity undervaluation. However,\nthere is only modest evidence that \"rms issue equity because recent pro\"ts have\nbeen insu$cient to fund activities (1.76 in Table 8), and even less indicating that\n\"rms issue equity after their ability to obtain funds from debt or convertibles is\ndiminished (rating of 1.15 in Table 10).\nFirms are reluctant to issue common stock when they perceive that it is\nundervalued (rating of 2.69, the most important equity issuance factor in\nTable 8). In a separate survey conducted one month after ours, when the Dow\nJones 30 was approaching a new record of 10,000, Graham (1999b) \"nds that\nmore than two-thirds of FEI executives feel that their common equity is\nundervalued by the market and that only 3% of CFOs think their stock is\novervalued, suggesting that the preference for pecking-order-like behavior\nmight be driven by managerial optimism (Heaton, 2000). Taken together, these\n\"ndings indicate that a large percentage of companies are hesitant to issue\ncommon equity because they feel their stock is undervalued. Many \"rms issue\nconvertible debt instead: equity undervaluation is the second most popular\nfactor a!ecting convertible debt policy (rating of 2.34 in Table 10), a response\nparticularly popular among growth \"rms (2.72).\nFinding that \"rms avoid equity when they perceive that it is undervalued is\ngenerally consistent with the pecking order. However, when we examine more\ncarefully how equity undervaluation a!ects \"nancing decisions, the support for\nthe pecking-order model wanes. In debt decisions, large (rating of 1.76 in Row\nd of Table 9), dividend-paying (1.65) \"rms are relatively more likely to say that\nequity undervaluation a!ects their debt policy (versus ratings of 1.37 for both\nsmall and nondividend-paying \"rms). In equity decisions, the relative import-\nance of stock valuation on equity issuance is not related to informational\nasymmetry as indicated by small size and nondividend-paying status, though it\nis more important for \"rms with low executive ownership. In general, these\n\"ndings are not consistent with the pecking-order idea that informationally\ninduced equity undervaluation causes \"rms to avoid equity \"nancing. Helwege\nand Liang (1996, p. 457) also \"nd that `asymmetric information variables have\nno power to predict the relative use of public bonds over equity.a\nIn sum, the importance of \"nancial #exibility and equity undervaluation to\nsecurity issuance decisions is generally consistent with the pecking-order model\nJ.R.

However, asymmetric information does not appear to\ncause the importance of these factors, as it should if the pecking-order model is\nthe true model of capital structure choice.\n5.2.2. Recent increase in price of common stock\nWe investigate whether \"rms issue stock during a `window of opportunitya\nthat arises because their stock price has recently increased, as argued by\nLoughran and Ritter (1995). Lucas and McDonald (1990) put an informational\nasymmetry spin on the desire to issue equity after stock price increases: If\na \"rm's stock price is undervalued due to informational asymmetry, it delays\nissuing until after an informational release (of good news) and the ensuing\nincrease in stock price.\nRecent stock price performance is the third most popular factor a!ecting\nequity-issuance decisions (rating of 2.53 in Table 8), in support of the `window of\nopportunitya. Consistent with Lucas and McDonald (1990), the window of\nopportunity is most important for \"rms su!ering from informational asymmet-\nries (i.e., not paying dividends).\n5.2.3. Signaling private information with debt and equity\nRoss (1977) and Leland and Pyle (1977) argue that \"rms use capital structure\nto signal their quality or future prospects. However, very few \"rms indicate that\ntheir debt policy is a!ected by factors consistent with signaling (rating of 0.96 in\nTable 9). In addition to small absolute importance, companies more likely to\nsu!er from informational asymmetries, such as small, private (0.51) \"rms, are\nrelatively unlikely to use debt to signal future prospects (see Row b in Table 9).\nWe also \"nd little evidence that \"rms issue equity to give the market a positive\nimpression of their prospects (rating of 1.31 in Table 8). Sending a positive signal\nvia equity issuance is relatively more popular among speculative, nondividend-\npaying \"rms.\n5.2.4. Private information and convertible stock issuance\nBrennan and Kraus (1987) and Brennan and Schwartz (1988) argue that the\ncall or conversion feature makes convertible debt relatively insensitive to asym-\nmetric information (between management and investors) about the risk of the\n\"rm. We \"nd moderate support for this argument. Firms use convertible debt to\nattract investors unsure about the riskiness of the company (rating of 2.07 in\nTable 10). This response is relatively more popular among \"rms for which\noutside investors are likely to know less than management about \"rm risk, i.e.,\nsmall \"rms (2.35) with large managerial ownership (2.47).\nStein (1992) argues that if \"rms privately know that their stock is under-\nvalued, they prefer to avoid issuing equity. At the same time, they want to\nminimize the distress costs that come with debt issuance. Convertible debt is\n`delayeda common stock that has lower distress costs than debt and smaller\n222\nJ.R. Graham, C.R. Harvey / Journal of Financial Economics 60 (2001) 187}243\nundervaluation than equity. We \"nd strong evidence consistent with Stein's\nargument that convertibles are `back-door equity.a Among \"rms that issue\nconvertible debt, the most popular factor is that convertibles are an inexpensive\nway to issue delayed common stock (rating of 2.49 in Table 10).\n5.2.5. Anticipating improvement in credit ratings\nHaving private information about credit quality can a!ect a \"rm's optimal\ndebt maturity. In theory, if \"rms privately know they are high quality but are\ncurrently assigned a low credit rating, they issue short-term debt because they\nexpect their rating to improve (Flannery, 1986; Kale and Noe, 1990). In practice,\nthe evidence that \"rms time their credit worthiness is weak. The mean response\nis only 0.85 (Row e, Table 11) that companies borrow short-term because they\nexpect their credit rating to improve. This response receives more support from\ncompanies with speculative grade debt (1.18) and those that do not pay divi-\ndends (0.99). Though not of large absolute magnitude, this last answer is\nconsistent with \"rms timing their credit ratings when they are subject to large\ninformational asymmetries.\n5.2.6. Timing market interest rates\nAlthough relatively few executives time changes in their credit ratings (some-\nthing about which they might reasonably have private information), we \"nd\nsurprising indications that they try to time the market in other ways. We inquire\nwhether executives attempt to time interest rates by issuing debt when they feel\nthat market interest rates are particularly low. The rating of 2.22 in Table\n6 provides moderately strong evidence that \"rms try to time the market in this\nsense. Market timing is especially important for large \"rms (2.40), which implies\nthat companies are more likely to time interest rates when they have a large or\nsophisticated treasury department.\nWe also \"nd evidence that \"rms issue short-term debt in an e!ort to time\nmarket interest rates. CFOs borrow short-term when they feel that short rates\nare low relative to long rates (1.89 in Table 11) or when they expect long-term\nrates to decline (1.78). Finally, we check if \"rms use foreign debt because foreign\ninterest rates are lower than domestic rates. There is moderate evidence that\nrelatively low foreign interest rates a!ect the decision to issue abroad (rating of\n2.19). Though insigni\"cant, small (2.33) growth (2.27) \"rms are more likely to\nmake this claim. If covered interest rate parity holds, it is not clear to us why\n\"rms pursue this strategy.\n5.3. Agency costs\n5.3.1. Conyicts between bondholders and equityholders\nMyers (1977) argues that investment decisions can be a!ected by the presence\nof long-term debt in a \"rm's capital structure.

Harvey / Journal of Financial Economics 60 (2001) 187}243\n225\nand pass up positive NPV projects if they perceive that the pro\"ts will be used to\npay o! existing debtholders. This cost is most acute among growth \"rms. Myers\n(1977) argues that \"rms can limit total debt, or use short-term debt, to minimize\nunderinvestment costs. Froot, Scharfstein, and Stein (1993) argue that \"rms can\nhedge or otherwise maintain \"nancial #exibility to avoid these costs of underin-\nvestment.\nWe ask \"rms if their choice between short- and long-term debt, or their\noverall debt policy, is related to their desire to pay long-term pro\"ts to share-\nholders, not debtholders. The absolute number of \"rms indicating that their\ndebt policy is a!ected by underinvestment concerns is small (rating of 1.01 in\nTable 6). However, more growth (1.09) than nongrowth \"rms (0.69) are likely to\nindicate that underinvestment problems are a concern, which is consistent with\nthe theory. We \"nd little support for the idea that short-term debt is used to\nalleviate the underinvestment problem. The mean response is only 0.94 (Row\nd in Table 11) that short-term borrowing is used to allow returns from new\nprojects to be captured by long-term shareholders, and there is no statistical\ndi!erence in the response between growth and nongrowth \"rms.\nOverall, support for the underinvestment argument is weak. This is interesting\nbecause it contrasts with the \"nding in many large sample studies that debt\nusage is inversely related to variables measuring growth options (i.e., market-\nto-book ratios), which those studies interpret as evidence that underinvestment\ncosts a!ects debt policy (e.g., Graham, 1996).\nStockholders capture investment returns above those required to service debt\npayments and other liabilities, and at the same time have limited liability when\nreturns are insu$cient to fully pay debtholders. Therefore, stockholders prefer\nhigh-risk projects, in con#ict with bondholder preferences. Leland and Toft\n(1996) argue that using short-term debt reduces this agency con#ict (see also\nBarnea et al., 1980).\nIn contrast to this hypothesis, however, we \"nd little evidence that executives\nissue short-term debt to minimize asset substitution problems. The mean re-\nsponse is only 0.53 (Table 11) that executives feel that short-term borrowing\nreduces the chance that shareholders will want to take on risky projects.\nGreen (1984) argues that convertible debt can circumvent the asset substitu-\ntion problem that arises when \"rms accept projects that are riskier than\nbondholders would prefer. However, we \"nd little evidence that \"rms use\nconvertibles to protect bondholders against unfavorable actions by managers or\nstockholders (rating of 0.62 in Table 10).\n5.3.2. Conyicts between managers and equityholders\nJensen (1986) and others argue that when a \"rm has ample free cash #ow, its\nmanagers can squander the cash by consuming perquisites or making ine$cient\ninvestment decisions. We inquire whether \"rms use debt to commit to pay out\nfree cash #ows and thereby discipline management into working e$ciently\n226\nJ.R. Graham, C.R. Harvey / Journal of Financial Economics 60 (2001) 187}243\nalong the lines suggested by Jensen. We \"nd very little evidence that \"rms\ndiscipline managers in this way (mean rating of 0.33, the second lowest rating\namong all factors a!ecting debt policy in Table 6). It is important to note,\nhowever, that 1) managers might be unwilling to admit to using debt in this\nmanner, or 2) perhaps a low rating on this question re#ects an unwillingness of\n\"rms to adopt Jensen's solution more than a weakness in Jensen's argument.\n5.4. Product market and industry factors\nBradley et al. (1984) \"nd that debt ratios di!er markedly across industries.\nOne explanation for this pattern is that the product market environment or\nnature of competition varies across industries in a way that a!ects optimal debt\npolicy. For example, Titman (1984) suggests that customers avoid purchasing\na \"rm's products if they think that the \"rm might go out of business (and\ntherefore not stand behind its products), especially if the products are unique;\nconsequently, \"rms that produce unique products might avoid using debt.\nBrander and Lewis (1986) model another way that production and \"nancing\ndecisions can be intertwined. They hypothesize that, by using substantial debt,\na \"rm can provide a credible threat to rivals that it will not reduce production.\nWe \"nd little evidence that product market factors a!ect debt decisions.\nExecutives assign a mean rating of 1.24 to the proposition that debt should be\nlimited so that a \"rm's customers or suppliers do not become concerned that the\n\"rm might go out of business (Table 6). Moreover, high-tech \"rms (which we\nassume produce unique products) are less likely than other \"rms to limit debt\nfor this reason, contrary to Titman's prediction. We do \"nd that, in comparison\nto nongrowth \"rms (1.00), relatively many growth \"rms (1.43) claim that cus-\ntomers might not purchase their products if they are worried that debt usage\nmight cause the \"rm to go out of business. This is consistent with Titman's\ntheory if growth \"rms produce unique products. Finally, there is no evidence\nsupporting the Brander and Lewis hypothesis that debt provides a credible\nproduction threat (rating of 0.40).\nThough we do not \"nd much evidence that product market factors drive\nindustry di!erences in debt ratios, we ask executives whether their capital\nstructure decisions are a!ected by the \"nancing policy of other \"rms in their\nindustries. This is important because some papers de\"ne a \"rm's target debt\nratio as the industry-wide ratio (e.g., Opler and Titman, 1998; Gilson, 1997).\nWe \"nd only modest evidence that managers are concerned about the debt\nlevels of their competitors (rating of 1.49 in Table 6). Recall, however, that credit\nratings are important to debt decisions and note that industry debt ratios are an\nimportant input for bond ratings. Rival debt ratios are relatively important for\nregulated companies (2.32), Fortune 500 \"rms (1.86), public \"rms (rating of 1.63\nversus 1.27 for private \"rms), and \"rms that target their debt ratio (1.60).\nMoreover, equity issuance decisions are not in#uenced greatly by the equity\nJ.R. Graham, C.R. Harvey / Journal of Financial Economics 60 (2001) 187}243\n227\npolicies of other \"rms in a given industry (rating of 1.45 in Table 8). Finally, we\n\"nd even less evidence that \"rms use convertibles because other \"rms in their\nindustry do so (1.10 in Table 10).\n5.5. Control contests\nCapital structure can be used to in#uence, or can be a!ected by, corporate\ncontrol contests and managerial share ownership (e.g., Harris and Raviv, 1988;\nStulz, 1988). We \"nd moderate evidence that \"rms issue equity to dilute the\nstock holdings of certain shareholders (rating of 2.14 in Table 8). This tactic is\npopular among speculative-grade companies (2.24); however, it is not related to\nthe number of shares held by managers. We also ask if \"rms use debt to reduce\nthe likelihood that the \"rm will become a takeover target. We \"nd little support\nfor this hypothesis (rating of 0.73 in Table 6).\n5.6. Risk management\nCapital structure can be used to manage risk. GeH czy et al. (1997, p. 1331) note\nthat `foreign denominated debt can act as a natural hedge of foreign revenuesa\nand displace the need to hedge with currency derivatives. We ask whether \"rms\nuse foreign debt because it acts as a natural hedge, and separately how impor-\ntant it is to keep the source close to the use of funds. Among the 31% of\nrespondents who seriously considered issuing foreign debt, the most popular\nreason they did so is to provide a natural hedge against foreign currency\ndevaluation (mean rating of 3.15 in Table 7). Providing a natural hedge is most\nimportant for public \"rms (3.21) with large foreign exposure (3.34). The second\nmost important factor a!ecting the use of foreign debt is keeping the source\nclose to the use of funds (rating of 2.67), especially for small (3.09), manufacturing\n\"rms (2.92).\nRisk-management practices can also explain why \"rms match the maturity of\nassets and liabilities. If asset and liability duration are not aligned, interest rate\n#uctuations can a!ect the amount of funds available for investment and day-to-\nday operations. We ask \"rms how they choose debt maturity. The most popular\nexplanation of how \"rms choose between short- and long-term debt is that they\nmatch debt maturity with asset life (rating of 2.60 in Table 11). Maturity-\nmatching is most important for small (2.69), private (2.85) \"rms.\n5.7. Practical, cash management considerations\nLiquidity and cash management a!ect corporate \"nancial decisions, often in\nways that are not as `deepa as the factors driving academic models. For\nexample, many companies issue long-term so that they do not have to re\"nance\nin `bad timesa (rating of 2.15 in Table 11). This is especially important for highly\n228\nJ.R. Graham, C.R. Harvey / Journal of Financial Economics 60 (2001) 187}243\nlevered (2.55), manufacturing (2.37) \"rms. The CFOs also say that equity is often\nissued simply to provide shares to bonus/option plans (2.34 in Table 8), parti-\ncularly among investment-grade \"rms (2.77) with a young CEO (2.65).\nThe hand-written responses indicate that practical considerations a!ect the\nmaturity structure of borrowing (see B.7 on the Internet site, Appendix B). Four\n\"rms explicitly say that they tie their scheduled principal repayments to their\nprojected ability to repay. Another six diversify debt maturity to limit the\nmagnitude of their re\"nancing activity in any given year. Other \"rms borrow for\nthe length of time they think they will need funds, or borrow short-term until\nsu$cient debt has accumulated to justify borrowing long-term.\n5.8. Other factors awecting capital structure\n5.8.1. Debt\nWe ask if having debt allows \"rms to bargain for concessions from employees\n(Chang, 1992; Hanka, 1998). We \"nd no indication that this is the case (mean\nrating of 0.16 in Table 6, the lowest rating for any question on the survey). Not\na single respondent said that debt is important or very important as a bargain-\ning device (rating of 3 or 4). We also check if \"rms issue debt after recently\naccumulating substantial pro\"ts (Opler and Titman, 1998). The executives do\nnot recognize this as an important factor a!ecting debt policy (rating 0.53 in\nTable 9).\nFourteen \"rms write that they choose debt to minimize their weighted\naverage cost of capital (see B.5 on the Internet site, Appendix B). Ten write,\nessentially, that they borrow to fund projects or growth, but only as needed. Five\nindicate that bond or bank covenants a!ect their debt policy.\n5.8.2. Common stock\nWe investigate whether concern about earnings dilution a!ects equity\nissuance decisions. The textbook view is that earnings are not diluted if a \"rm\nearns the required return on the new equity. Conversely, if funds are obtained by\nissuing debt, the number of shares remains constant and so EPS can increase.\nHowever, the equity is levered and therefore more risky, so Modigliani and\nMiller's `conservation of valuea tells us that the stock price will not increase due\nto higher EPS. Nonetheless, Brealey and Myers (1996) indicate that there is\na common belief among executives that share issuance dilutes earnings per share\n(on p. 396, Brealey and Myers call this view a `fallacya). To investigate this issue,\nwe ask if earnings per share concerns a!ect decisions about issuing common\nstock.\nAmong the 38% of \"rms that seriously considered issuing common equity\nduring the sample period, earnings dilution is the most important factor a!ect-\ning their decision (mean rating of 2.84 in Table 8 and a mean rating of 3.18\namong public \"rms). The popularity of this response is intriguing (see Fig. 7). It\nJ.R. Graham, C.R. Harvey / Journal of Financial Economics 60 (2001) 187}243\n229\nFig. 7. Survey evidence on some of the factors that a!ect the decision to issue common stock. The\nsurvey is based on the responses of 392 CFOs.\neither indicates that executives focus more than they should on earnings dilution\n(if the standard textbook view is correct), or that the standard textbook treat-\nment misses an important aspect of earnings dilution. EPS dilution is a big\nconcern among regulated companies (3.60), even though in many cases the\nregulatory process ensures that utilities earn their required cost of capital,\nimplying that EPS dilution should not a!ect share price. Concern about EPS\ndilution is strong among large (3.12), dividend-paying \"rms (3.06). EPS dilution\nis less important when the CEO has an MBA (2.62) than when he or she does not\n(2.95), perhaps because the executive has read Brealey and Myers!\nWe inquire whether common stock is a \"rm's least risky or cheapest source of\nfunds. Williamson (1988) argues that equity is a cheap source of funds with\nwhich to \"nance low-speci\"city assets. A modest number of the executives state\nthat they use equity because it is the least risky source of funds (rating of 1.76 in\nTable 8). The idea that equity has low risk is more popular among \"rms with the\ncharacteristics of a new or start-up \"rm: small (1.93) with growth options (2.07).\nThe idea that common stock is the cheapest source of funds is less popular\n(rating of 1.10), although \"rms with start-up characteristics are more likely to\nhave this belief. Unreported analysis indicates that there is a positive correlation\nbetween believing that equity is the cheapest and that it is the least risky source\nof funds.\nNine companies indicate that they issue common stock because it is the\n`preferred currencya for making acquisitions, especially for the pooling method\nof accounting (see B.9 on the Internet site, Appendix B). Two \"rms write that\n230\nJ.R. Graham, C.R. Harvey / Journal of Financial Economics 60 (2001) 187}243\nFig. 8. Survey evidence on the factors that a!ect the decision to issue convertible debt. The survey is\nbased on the responses of 392 CFOs.\nthey issue stock because it is the natural form of \"nancing for them in their\ncurrent stage of corporate development.\n5.8.3. Convertible debt\nWe ask the executives whether the ability to call or force conversion is an\nimportant feature a!ecting convertible debt policy. Among the one-in-\"ve \"rms\nthat seriously considered issuing convertible debt, there is moderate evidence\nthat executives like convertibles because of the ability to call or force conversion\n(rating of 2.29 in Table 10). Though not a direct test, the popularity of the\ncall/conversion feature is consistent with Mayers' (1998) hypothesis that con-\nvertible debt allows funding of pro\"table future projects but attenuates overin-\nvestment incentives. The factors used in decisions to issue convertible debt are\npresented in Fig. 8.\nBillingsley et al. (1985) document that convertibles cost on average 50 basis\npoints less than straight debt. However, relatively few CFOs indicate that they\nuse convertible debt because it is less expensive than straight debt (rating of\n1.85). Companies run by mature executives are more likely to issue convertibles\nbecause they are less costly than straight debt (2.50).\nBillingsley and Smith (1996) also \"nd that convertibles are favored as delayed\nequity and because management feels that common equity is undervalued.\nContrary to our results, Billingsley and Smith \"nd fairly strong evidence that\n\"rms are in#uenced by the convertible use of other \"rms in their industry. Also\nin contrast to our results, they \"nd that the most important factor a!ecting the\nuse of convertibles is the lower cash costs/coupon rate versus straight debt. One\ndi!erence between our study and theirs is that they request a response relative to\nJ.R. Graham, C.R. Harvey / Journal of Financial Economics 60 (2001) 187}243\n231\na speci\"c o!ering among \"rms that actually issue convertible debt. We condi-\ntion only on whether a \"rm seriously considered issuing convertibles.\n5.8.4. Foreign debt\nGrinblatt and Titman (1998) note that capital markets have become increas-\ningly global in recent decades and that U.S. \"rms frequently raise funds over-\nseas. We indicate above that \"rms issue foreign debt in response to tax\nincentives, to keep the source close to the use of funds, and in an attempt to take\nadvantage of low foreign interest rates. Five \"rms write that they borrow\noverseas to broaden their sources of \"nancing (see B.8 on the Internet site,\nAppendix B). Few \"rms indicate that foreign regulations require them to issue\nabroad (rating of 0.61 in Table 7).\n6. Conclusions\nOur survey of the practice of corporate \"nance is both reassuring and\npuzzling. For example, it is reassuring that NPV is dramatically more important\nnow as a project evaluation method than, as indicated in past surveys, it was 10\nor 20 years ago. The CAPM is also widely used. However, it is surprising that\nmore than half of the respondents would use their \"rm's overall discount rate to\nevaluate a project in an overseas market, even though the project likely has\ndi!erent risk attributes than the overall \"rm. This indicates that practitioners\nmight not apply the CAPM or NPV rule correctly. It is also interesting that\nCFOs pay very little attention to risk factors based on momentum and book-\nto-market value.\nWe identify fundamental di!erences between small and large \"rms. Our\nresearch suggests that small \"rms are less sophisticated when it comes to\nevaluating risky projects. Small \"rms are signi\"cantly less likely to use the NPV\ncriterion or the capital asset pricing model and its variants. Perhaps these and\nour other \"ndings about the e!ect of \"rm size will help academics understand\nthe pervasive relation between size and corporate practices. Further, the fact\nthat the practice of corporate \"nance di!ers based on \"rm size could be an\nunderlying cause of size-related asset pricing anomalies.\nIn our analysis of capital structure, we \"nd that informal criteria such as\n\"nancial #exibility and credit ratings are the most important debt policy factors.\nOther informal criteria such as EPS dilution and recent stock price appreciation\nare the most important factors in#uencing equity issuance. The degree of stock\nundervaluation is also important to equity issuance, and we know from other\nsurveys that most executives feel their stock is undervalued.\nWe \"nd moderate support that \"rms follow the trade-o! theory and target\ntheir debt ratio. Other results, such as the importance of equity undervaluation\nand \"nancial #exibility, are generally consistent with the pecking-order view.\nHowever, the evidence in favor of these theories does not hold up as well under\n232\nJ.R. Graham, C.R. Harvey / Journal of Financial Economics 60 (2001) 187}243\ncloser scrutiny (e.g., the evidence is generally not consistent with informational\nasymmetry causing pecking-order-like behavior), and is weaker still for more\nsubtle theories. We \"nd mixed or little evidence that signaling, transactions\ncosts, underinvestment costs, asset substitution, bargaining with employees, free\ncash #ow considerations, and product market concerns a!ect capital structure\nchoice. Table 12 summarizes our capital structure \"ndings.\nIn summary, executives use the mainline techniques that business schools\nhave taught for years, NPV and CAPM, to value projects and to estimate the\ncost of equity. Interestingly, \"nancial executives are much less likely to follow\nthe academically proscribed factors and theories when determining capital\nstructure. This last \"nding raises possibilities that require additional thought\nand research. Perhaps the relatively weak support for many capital structure\ntheories indicates that it is time to critically reevaluate the assumptions and\nimplications of these mainline theories. Alternatively, perhaps the theories are\nvalid descriptions of what \"rms should do}but corporations ignore the theoret-\nical advice. One explanation for this last possibility is that business schools\nmight be better at teaching capital budgeting and the cost of capital than at\nteaching capital structure. Moreover, perhaps NPV and the CAPM are more\nwidely understood than capital structure theories because they make more\nprecise predictions and have been accepted as mainstream views for longer.\nAdditional research is needed to investigate these issues.\nTable 12\nSummary of the relation between survey evidence and capital structure theories\nA capital structure theory or concept is listed in the \"rst column, followed by the related survey\nevidence in the right column. \u0002 (\u0001) indicates that the evidence drawn from the unconditional\nresponses to a survey question supports (does not support) the idea in the \"rst column.

Nonresponse bias and other issues related to survey data\nWe perform several experiments to investigate whether nonresponse bias\nmight a!ect our results. The \"rst experiment, suggested by Wallace and Mellor\n(1988), compares the responses for \"rms that returned the survey on time (i.e., by\nFebruary 23) to those that did not return the survey until February 24, 1999 or\nlater. The \"rms that did not respond on time can be thought of as a sample from\nthe nonresponse group, in the sense that they did not return the survey until we\npestered them further. We \"rst test, for each question, whether the mean\nresponse for the early respondents di!ers from the mean for the late respon-\ndents. There are 88 questions not related to \"rm characteristics. The mean\nanswers for the early and late respondents are statistically di!erent for only eight\n(13) of these 88 questions at a 5% (10%) level.\nBecause the answers are correlated across di!erent questions, we also perform\nmultivariate \u0001\u0003 tests comparing the early and late responses. We calculate\nmultivariate test statistics for each set of subquestions, grouped by the main\nquestion. (That is, one \u0001\u0003 is calculated for the 12 subquestions related to the \"rst\nquestion on the survey, another \u0001\u0003 for the six subquestions related to the second\nsurvey question, etc.) Out of the 10 multivariate \u0001\u0003 s comparing the means for\nthe early and late responses, none (two) are signi\"cantly di!erent at a 5% (10%)\nlevel. Following the order of the tables as they appear in the text, the multivari-\nate analysis of variance p-values for each of the ten questions are 0.209, 0.063,\n0.085, 0.892, 0.124, 0.705, 0.335, 0.922, 0.259, and 0.282. A low p-value indicates\nsigni\"cant di!erences between the early and late responses. Finally, a single\nmultivariate \u0001\u0003 across all 88 subquestions does not detect signi\"cant di!erences\nbetween the early and late responses ( p-value of 0.254). The rationale of Wallace\nand Mellor suggests that because the responses for these two groups of \"rms are\nsimilar, non-response bias is not a major problem.\nThe second set of experiments, suggested by Moore and Reichert (1983),\ninvestigates possible non-response bias by comparing characteristics of respon-\nding \"rms to characteristics for the population at large. If the characteristics\nbetween the two groups match, then the sample can be thought of as represent-\ning the population. This task is somewhat challenging because we have only\nlimited information about the FEI population of \"rms. (Given that most\nFortune 500 \"rms are also in the FEI population, we focus on FEI character-\nistics. We ignore any di!erences in population characteristics that may be\nattributable to the 187 \"rms that are in the Fortune 500 but not in FEI.) We\nhave reliable information on three characteristics for the population of \"rms\nthat belong to FEI: general industry classi\"cation, public versus private owner-\nship, and number of employees.\nWe \"rst use \u0001\u0003 goodness-of-\"t analysis to determine whether the responses\nrepresent the industry groupings in roughly the same proportion as that found\nin the FEI population. Sixty-three percent of FEI members are from heavy\nJ.R. Graham, C.R. Harvey / Journal of Financial Economics 60 (2001) 187}243\n237\nmanufacturing industries (manufacturing, energy, and transportation), as are\n62% of the respondents. These percentages are not signi\"cantly di!erent at the\n5% level. Therefore, the heavy manufacturing versus non-manufacturing break-\ndown that we use in the tables is representative of the FEI population. We also\nexamine public versus private ownership. Sixty percent of FEI \"rms are publicly\nowned, as are 64% of the sample \"rms. Again, these numbers are not statistically\ndi!erent, suggesting that our numbers represent the FEI population, and also\nthat our public versus private analysis is appropriate.\nAlthough we do not have reliable information about the dividend policies,\nP/E ratios, sales revenue, or debt ratios for the FEI population, our analysis\nrelies heavily on these variables, so we perform Monte Carlo simulations to\ndetermine the representativeness of our sample. Speci\"cally, we take a random\nsample of 392 \"rms from the Compustat database, stratifying on the number of\nemployees in FEI \"rms. That is, we sample from Compustat so that 15.4% of the\ndraws are from \"rms with at least 20,000 employees, 24.7% are from \"rms with\nbetween 5,000 and 19,999 employees, etc., because these are the percentages for\nthe FEI population. We then calculate the mean debt ratio, sales revenue, and\nP/E ratio (ignoring \"rms with negative earnings), and the percentage of \"rms\nthat pay dividends for the randomly drawn \"rms. We repeat this process 1,000\ntimes to determine an empirical distribution of mean values for each variable.\nWe then compare the mean values for our sample to the empirical distribution.\nIf, for example, the mean debt ratio for the responding \"rms is larger than 950 of\nthe mean debt ratios in the Monte Carlo simulation, we would conclude that\nthere is statistical evidence that respondent \"rms are more highly levered than\nare \"rms in the overall population.\nThe sample values for sales revenue and debt ratios fall comfortably near\nthe middle of the empirical distributions, indicating that the sample is repre-\nsentative for these two characteristics. The mean P/E ratio of 17 for the sample\nis statistically smaller than the mean for the Compustat sample (overall mean\nof approximately 20). Fifty-four percent of the sample \"rms pay dividends,\ncompared to\napproximately 45% in\nthe strati\"ed Compustat sample.\nAlthough the sample and population di!er statistically for these last two traits,\nthe economic di!erences are small enough to indicate that our sample is\nrepresentative of the population from which it is drawn. There are at least\nthree reasons why our Monte Carlo experiment might indicate statistical\ndi!erences, even if our sample \"rms are actually representative of the FEI\npopulation: (1) there are systematic di!erences between the Compustat and\nFEI populations not controlled for with the strati\"cation based on number\nof employees, (2) the strati\"cation is based on FEI \"rms only, although the\nsurvey `oversamplesa Fortune 500 \"rms, and (3) we deleted \"rms with\nnegative P/E ratios in the Monte Carlo simulations, although survey res-\npondents might have entered a P/E ratio of zero or something else if they had\nnegative earnings.\n238\nJ.R. Graham, C.R. Harvey / Journal of Financial Economics 60 (2001) 187}243\nFinally, given that much corporate \"nance research analyzes Compustat\n\"rms, we repeat the Monte Carlo experiment without stratifying by number of\nemployees. That is, we randomly draw 392 \"rms (1,000 times) from Compustat\nwithout conditioning on the number of employees. This experiment tells us\nwhether our sample \"rms adequately represent Compustat \"rms, to provide an\nindication of how directly our survey results can be compared to Compustat-\nbased research. The mean debt ratio, sales revenue, and P/E ratios are not\nstatistically di!erent from the means in the Compustat data; however, the\npercentage of \"rms paying dividends is smaller than for the overall Compustat\nsample. Aside from dividend payout, the \"rms that responded to our survey are\nsimilar to Compustat \"rms.\nIf one accepts that nonresponse bias is small, there are still concerns about\nsurvey data. For one thing, the respondents might not answer truthfully. Given\nthat the survey is anonymous, we feel this problem is minimal. Moreover, our\nassessment from the phone conversations is that the executives would not take\nthe time to \"ll out a survey if their intent was to be untruthful.\nAnother potential problem with survey data is that the questions, no matter\nhow carefully crafted, either might not be properly understood or might not\nelicit the appropriate information. For example, Stigler (1966) asks managers if\ntheir \"rms maximize pro\"ts. The general response is that, no, they take care of\ntheir employees, are responsible corporate citizens, etc. However, when Stigler\nasks whether the \"rms could increase pro\"ts by increasing or decreasing prices,\nthe answer is again no. Observations such as these can be used to argue that\nthere is some sort of `economic Darwinisma, in which the \"rms that survive\nmust be doing the proper things, even if unintentionally. Or, as Milton Fried-\nman (1953) notes, a good pool player has the skill to knock the billiards balls\ninto one another just right, even if he or she can not solve a di!erential equation.\nFinally, Cli! Smith tells about a chef who, after tasting the un\"nished product,\nalways knew exactly which ingredient to add to perfect the day's recipe, but\ncould never write down the proper list of ingredients after the meal was\ncomplete. These examples suggest that managers might use the proper tech-\nniques, or at least take the correct actions, even if their answers to a survey do\nnot indicate so. If other \"rms copy the actions of successful \"rms, then it is\npossible that many \"rms take appropriate actions without thinking within the\nbox of an academic model.\nThis set of critiques is impossible to completely refute. We have attempted to\nbe very careful when designing the questions on the survey. We also feel that by\ncontrasting the answers conditional on \"rm characteristics, we should be able to\ndetect patterns in the responses that shed light on the importance of di!erent\ntheories, even if the questions are not perfect in every dimension. Ultimately,\nhowever, the analysis we perform and conclusions we reach must be interpreted\nkeeping in mind that our data are from a survey. Having said this, we feel\nthat these data are representative and provide much unique information that\nJ.R. Graham, C.R.

According to Myers (1984), due to adverse selection,\nﬁrms prefer internal to external ﬁnance. When outside funds are necessary, ﬁrms\nprefer debt to equity because of lower information costs associated with debt issues.\nEquity is rarely issued. These ideas were reﬁned into a key testable prediction by\nShyam-Sunder and Myers (1999). The ﬁnancing deﬁcit should normally be matched\ndollar-for-dollar by a change in corporate debt. As a result, if ﬁrms follow the\npecking order, then in a regression of net debt issues on the ﬁnancing deﬁcit, a slope\ncoefﬁcient of one is observed.\nShyam-Sunder and Myers (1999) ﬁnd strong support for this prediction in a\nsample of 157 ﬁrms that had traded continuously over the period 1971 to 1989. This\nis an attractive and inﬂuential result. The pecking order is offered as a highly\nparsimonious empirical model of corporate leverage that is descriptively reasonable.\nOf course, 157 ﬁrms is a relatively small sample from the set of all publicly traded\nAmerican ﬁrms. It is therefore important to understand whether the pecking order\ntheory is broadly applicable.\nIn this paper, we study the extent to which the pecking order theory of capital\nstructure provides a satisfactory account of the ﬁnancing behavior of publicly traded\nAmerican ﬁrms over the 1971 to 1998 period. Our analysis has three elements. First,\nwe provide evidence about the broad patterns of ﬁnancing activity. This provides the\nempirical context for the more formal regression tests. It also serves as a check on the\nsigniﬁcance of external ﬁnance and equity issues. Second, we examine a number of\nimplications of the pecking order in the context of Shyam-Sunder and Myers’ (1999)\nregression tests. Finally, we check to see whether the pecking order theory receives\ngreater support among ﬁrms that face particularly severe adverse selection problems.\nThe pecking order theory derives much of its inﬂuence from a view that it ﬁts\nnaturally with a number of facts about how companies use external ﬁnance.1 Myers\n(2001) reports that external ﬁnance covers only a small proportion of capital\nformation and that equity issues are minor, with the bulk of external ﬁnance being\ndebt. These key claims do not match the evidence for publicly traded American\nﬁrms, particularly during the 1980s and 1990s. External ﬁnance is much more\nsigniﬁcant than is usually recognized in that it often exceeds investments. Equity\nﬁnance is a signiﬁcant component of external ﬁnance. On average, net equity issues\ncommonly exceed net debt issues. Particularly striking is the fact that net equity\nissues track the ﬁnancing deﬁcit much more closely than do net debt issues.\nShyam-Sunder and Myers (1999) focus on a regression test of the pecking order.\nIn this test one needs to construct the ﬁnancing deﬁcit from information in the\ncorporate accounts. The ﬁnancing deﬁcit is constructed from an aggregation of\n1The pecking order theory also derives support from indirect sources of evidence. Eckbo (1986) and\nAsquith and Mullins (1986) provide event study evidence that adverse selection is more signiﬁcant for\nequity issues than for debt issues. Cadsby et al. (1990) provide experimental evidence of adverse selection\nin company ﬁnancing.\nM.Z. Frank, V.K. Goyal / Journal of Financial Economics 67 (2003) 217–248\n218\ndividends, investment, change in working capital and internal cash ﬂows. If the\npecking order theory is correct, then the construction of the ﬁnancing deﬁcit variable\nis a justiﬁed aggregation. Under the pecking order, each component of ﬁnancing\ndeﬁcit should have the predicted dollar-for-dollar impact on corporate debt. The\nevidence does not support this hypothesis.\nEven if a theory is not strictly correct, when compared to other theories it might\nstill do a better job of organizing the available evidence. The pecking order is a\ncompetitor to other mainstream empirical models of corporate leverage. Major\nempirical alternatives such as the model tested by Rajan and Zingales (1995) use a\ndifferent information set to account for corporate leverage. It is therefore of interest\nto see how the ﬁnancing deﬁcit performs in a nested model that also includes\nconventional factors. The pecking order theory implies that the ﬁnancing deﬁcit\nought to wipe out the effects of other variables. If the ﬁnancing deﬁcit is simply one\nfactor among many that ﬁrms tradeoff, then what is left is a generalized version of\nthe tradeoff theory.\nWe ﬁnd that the ﬁnancing deﬁcit does not wipe out the effects of conventional\nvariables. The information in the ﬁnancing deﬁcit appears to be factored in along\nwith many other things that ﬁrms take into account. This is true across ﬁrm sizes and\nacross time periods.\nSince the pecking order does not explain broad patterns of corporate ﬁnance, it is\nnatural to examine narrower sets of ﬁrms. According to the pecking order theory,\nﬁnancing behavior is driven by adverse selection costs. The theory should perform\nbest among ﬁrms that face particularly severe adverse selection problems. Small\nhigh-growth ﬁrms are often thought of as ﬁrms with large information asymmetries.\nContrary to this hypothesis, small high-growth ﬁrms do not behave according to\nthe pecking order theory. In fact, the pecking order works best in samples of large\nﬁrms that continuously existed during the 1970s and the 1980s. Large ﬁrms with long\nuninterrupted trading records are not usually considered to be ﬁrms that suffer the\nmost acute adverse selection problems.\nTo understand the evidence it is important to recognize the changing population\nof public ﬁrms. Compared to the 1970s and 1980s, many more small and\nunproﬁtable ﬁrms became publicly traded during the 1990s. Since small ﬁrms\ngenerally do not behave according to the pecking order, this accounts for part of the\nreason that the pecking order theory is rejected. But the time period has a stronger\neffect than just this. For ﬁrms of all sizes, the ﬁnancing deﬁcit plays a declining role\nover time.\nPrevious literature provides other evidence pertinent to a general assessment of the\npecking order theory. The pecking order theory predicts that high-growth ﬁrms,\ntypically with large ﬁnancing needs, will end up with high debt ratios because of a\nmanager’s reluctance to issue equity. Smith and Watts (1992) and Barclay et al.\n(2001) suggest precisely the opposite. High-growth ﬁrms consistently use less debt in\ntheir capital structure.\nThe pecking order theory makes predictions about the maturity and priority\nstructure of debt. Securities with the lowest information costs should be issued ﬁrst,\nbefore the ﬁrm issues securities with higher information costs. This suggests that\nM.Z. Frank, V.K. Goyal / Journal of Financial Economics 67 (2003) 217–248\n219\nshort-term debt should be exhausted before the ﬁrm issues long-term debt.\nCapitalized leases and secured debt should be issued before any unsecured debt is\nissued. Barclay and Smith (1995a, b) ﬁnd that 50% of their ﬁrm-year observations\nhave no debt issued with less than one-year maturity, 23% have no secured debt, and\n54% have no capital leases. It seems difﬁcult to understand this evidence within a\npure pecking order point of view.\nChirinko and Singha (2000) question the interpretation of the Shyam-Sunder and\nMyers (1999) regression test. Chirinko and Singha show that equity issues can create\na degree of negative bias in the Shyam-Sunder and Myers test. Suppose that ﬁrms\nactually follow the pecking order theory, but that these ﬁrms issue an empirically\nobserved amount of equity. In that case, they show that the predicted regression\ncoefﬁcient is actually 0.74 rather than one. This amount of bias is not trivial, but it\nstill leaves the coefﬁcient very far from the magnitudes of slope coefﬁcients that are\nobserved. Chirinko and Singha also point out that if, contrary to the pecking order,\nﬁrms follow a policy of using debt and equity in ﬁxed proportions, then the Shyam-\nSunder and Myers regression will identify this ratio. As a result, ﬁnding a coefﬁcient\nnear one would not disprove the tradeoff theory. Chirinko and Singha’s cautionary\nnote reinforces an important methodological point. Most empirical tests have\nvarious weaknesses. It is therefore important to examine the predictions of a theory\nfrom a number of points of view rather than relying solely on a single test.\nThe structure of the rest of this paper is as follows. Section 2 presents the pecking\norder theory and the associated empirical hypotheses. The data are described in\nSection 3. Section 4 presents the empirical results. Conclusions are presented in\nSection 5.\n2. Theory\nThe pecking order theory is from Myers (1984) and Myers and Majluf (1984).\nSince it is well known, we can be brief. Suppose that there are three sources of\nfunding available to ﬁrms: retained earnings, debt, and equity. Retained earnings\nhave no adverse selection problem. Equity is subject to serious adverse selection\nproblems while debt has only a minor adverse selection problem. From the point of\nview of an outside investor, equity is strictly riskier than debt. Both have an adverse\nselection risk premium, but that premium is large on equity. Therefore, an outside\ninvestor will demand a higher rate of return on equity than on debt. From the\nperspective of those inside the ﬁrm, retained earnings are a better source of funds\nthan is debt, and debt is a better deal than equity ﬁnancing. Accordingly, the ﬁrm\nwill fund all projects using retained earnings if possible. If there is an inadequate\namount of retained earnings, then debt ﬁnancing will be used. Thus, for a ﬁrm in\nnormal operations, equity will not be used and the ﬁnancing deﬁcit will match the net\ndebt issues.\nIn reality, company operations and the associated accounting structures are more\ncomplex than the standard pecking order representation. This implies that in order\nto test the pecking order, some form of aggregation must be used.\nM.Z. Frank, V.K.

The empirical speciﬁcation is thus given as\nDDit ¼ a þ bPODEFit þ eit;\nð2Þ\nwhere eit is a well-behaved error term. In Eq. (2), the pecking order hypothesis is that\na ¼ 0 and bPO ¼ 1: Shyam-Sunder and Myers (1999) ﬁnd that the pecking order\nmodel is statistically rejected. However it does provide a good ﬁrst-order\napproximation of their data.\nIn contrast to the accounting deﬁnition, Shyam-Sunder and Myers (1999) include\nthe current portion of long-term debt as part of the ﬁnancing deﬁcit beyond its role\nin the change in working capital. Following their argument, the relevant ﬂow of\nfunds deﬁcit ðDEFSSM\nt\nÞ is deﬁned as\nDEFSSM\nt\n¼ DIVt þ ItþDWt þ Rt \u0002 Ct:\nð3Þ\nIf their alternative version of the ﬁnancing deﬁcit is to be used, then replace DEFit\nwith DEFSSM\nt\nin Eq. (2). We try both approaches and ﬁnd that empirically the\ncurrent portion of long-term debt does not appear to belong in the deﬁnition of\nDEFit: With the exception of column (7) of Table 5, we report only the results for\nwhich the current portion of long-term debt is not included as a separate component\nof the ﬁnancing deﬁcit. This choice favors the pecking order, but it does not affect\nour conclusions.\nHow is cash to be treated in the ﬁnancing deﬁcit? Changes in cash and cash\nequivalents are included with changes in working capital. Cash could be correlated\nwith the amount of debt issued. This could arise in the presence of lumpy debt and\nM.Z. Frank, V.K. Goyal / Journal of Financial Economics 67 (2003) 217–248\n221\nequity issues, with excess proceeds parked for some period of time in excess cash\nbalances. If this takes place over a number of years, a more complex dynamic theory\nof leverage is needed. We report results in which the change in cash and cash\nequivalents are included. This choice favors the pecking order, but the conclusions\nare not affected.\nIn a panel regression, one can treat all year-ﬁrm combinations as equally\nimportant independent observations. If that is done, then a simple regression can be\nrun. If one is willing to accept the classical error term assumptions, then standard\nﬁxed-effects or random-effects panel estimators may be used. Yet another possibility\nis to downplay the differences across time and focus on the cross-sectional\ndifferences. One could follow Fama and MacBeth (1973) and use the average of a\nseries of annual cross-sectional regressions as the point estimate and use the time\nseries of these estimates to construct standard errors. This is the approach taken by\nFama and French (2002). We have tried these alternatives and our conclusions are\nnot sensitive to the choice of approach.\nAccording to theory, the speciﬁcation in Eq. (2) is deﬁned in levels. When actually\nestimating Eq. (2), it is conventional to scale the variables by assets or by sales. The\npecking order theory does not require such scaling. Of course, in an algebraic\nequality if the right-hand side and the left-hand side are divided by the same value,\nthe equality remains intact. However, in a regression the estimated coefﬁcient can be\nseriously affected if the scaling is by a variable that is correlated with the variables in\nthe equation. Scaling is most often justiﬁed as a method of controlling for differences\nin ﬁrm size. The reported results are based on variables scaled by net assets (total\nassets minus current liabilities). We replicate all the tests by scaling variables by total\nbook assets, by the sum of book debt plus market equity, and by sales. The results\nare very similar and do not affect our conclusions.\nThere is an important econometric issue that needs to be addressed. The pecking\norder theory treats the ﬁnancing deﬁcit as exogenous. The ﬁnancing deﬁcit includes\ninvestment and dividends. Yet, much ﬁnancial theory is devoted to attempting to\nunderstand the determinants of these factors. As a result, it is not entirely obvious\nthat the components of the ﬁnancing deﬁcit should be properly regarded as\nexogenous. If they are truly endogenous, then the regression in Eq. (2) is\nmisspeciﬁed. If a model is misspeciﬁed, then small changes to the speciﬁcation\nmay lead to large changes in the coefﬁcient estimates. The model is also likely to be\nunstable across time periods and its performance would likely not generalize to other\nsamples of ﬁrms. Such instability would itself be indicative of a failure of the model.\nIn order to deal with these concerns, two steps are taken. First, all tests are\nsubjected to a large number of robustness checks. In most cases the ﬁndings are\nrobust. However, the ﬁndings are not robust on one crucial dimension. Requiring\nﬁrms to have complete trading records over the period 1971–1989 makes a big\ndifference to the coefﬁcient estimates. Second, the ability of the estimated models to\npredict debt issues by a holdout sample of ﬁrms is directly examined. This is a simple\nway to address concerns about model misspeciﬁcation. A model may ﬁt well within\nsample but its performance may not generalize. Such a model is, of course, much less\ninteresting than an empirical model that also performs well out of sample.\nM.Z. Frank, V.K. Goyal / Journal of Financial Economics 67 (2003) 217–248\n222\nThe ability of each ﬁtted model to predict is tested on data from the ﬁve years\nsubsequent to (or prior to) the time period over which the model is ﬁt. For each ﬁrm\nyear in the holdout sample, we plug the actual values of the exogenous variables into\nthe ﬁtted equation. This provides a predicted value of the endogenous variable\n(usually net debt issue). In this manner, we obtain ﬁve years of ﬁrm-speciﬁc\npredictions from each ﬁtted model. To assess the quality of these predictions, the\npredicted debt issues are regressed against a constant and the actual debt issues. A\ngood ﬁt will be reﬂected in an intercept of zero, a slope of one, and a high R2: In\norder to save space we only report the R2 that is obtained on the hold out sample.\n2.1. Using the same information: disaggregation of the ﬁnancing deﬁcit\nTo test the pecking order theory we need to aggregate the accounting data. Is the\naggregation step justiﬁed? It seems plausible that there could be information in\nDEFit that helps to account for DDit; but not in the manner hypothesized by the\npecking order theory. An easy way to check whether the aggregation step is justiﬁed\nis to run the equation on a disaggregated basis and then check whether the data\nsatisﬁes the aggregation step.\nConsider the following speciﬁcation,\nDDit ¼ a þ bDIVDIVt þ bIIt þ bWDWt \u0002 bCCt þ eit:\nð4Þ\nUnder the pecking order theory, it is DEFit itself that matters. A unit increase in any\nof the components of DEFit must have the same unit impact on DDit: The pecking\norder hypothesis is thus bDIV ¼ bI ¼ bW ¼ bC ¼ 1: If that hypothesis is correct, then\nthe aggregation in Eq. (1) is justiﬁed. If however, the signiﬁcance is actually only\ndriven by some of the individual components, then alternative coefﬁcient patterns\nare possible.\n2.2. Using other information to account for leverage\nThe pecking order test implicitly makes different exogeneity assumptions and uses\na different information set than is conventional in empirical research on leverage and\nleverage-adjusting behavior. Harris and Raviv (1991) explain the conventional set of\nvariables and then Rajan and Zingales (1995) distill these variables into a simple\ncross-sectional model.\nThe conventional set of explanatory factors for leverage is the conventional set for\na reason. The variables have survived many tests. As explained below, these variables\nalso have conventional interpretations. Excluding such variables from consideration\nis therefore potentially a signiﬁcant omission. It is also true that including such\nvariables potentially poses a tough test for the pecking order theory.\nThe conventional leverage regression is intended to explain the level of leverage,\nwhile the pecking order regression is intended to explain the change rather than the\nlevel. As long as the shocks are uncorrelated across years, we can equally well run the\nconventional speciﬁcation in ﬁrst differences. Of course, a lower R2 will be obtained.\nThe assumption of uncorrelated shocks is unlikely literally correct. When we run the\nM.Z. Frank, V.K. Goyal / Journal of Financial Economics 67 (2003) 217–248\n223\nconventional regression in ﬁrst differences, we expect to lose some accuracy.\nRunning the conventional regression in ﬁrst differences may also bias the variable\ncoefﬁcients towards zero. It turns out that this bias is not large enough to alter our\nconclusions about the relative empirical validity of the two approaches. The beneﬁt\nis that we then have an appropriate speciﬁcation in which to nest the ﬁnancing deﬁcit\nvariable. Alternatively, one could run a regression that explains the level of leverage,\nthen use a cumulated past ﬁnancing deﬁcit variable to represent the pecking order. If\nthat is done there is an issue about when to start the cumulating. We try such a\nprocedure and obtain results that are very similar to those reported in Table 7.\nAt the heart of the conventional empirical analysis is a regression of leverage on\nfour factors: tangibility of assets (denoted T), market-to-book ratio (denoted MTB),\nlog sales (denoted LS), and proﬁtability (denoted P). Let D denote the ﬁrst\ndifferences between years. Our version of the basic regression equation is therefore\nDDi ¼ a þ bTDTi þ bMTBDMTBi þ bLSDLSi þ bPDPi þ bDEFDEFi þ ei:\nð5Þ\nEq. (5) is simply a conventional regression run in ﬁrst differences but with ﬁnancing\ndeﬁcit as an added factor. In the conventional regression, this term is not present.\nFrom the perspective of testing the pecking order, the most important of the\nconventional variables is tangibility. According to Harris and Raviv (1991), under\nthe pecking order theory, one might expect that ﬁrms with few tangible assets would\nhave greater asymmetric information problems. Thus, ﬁrms with few tangible assets\nwill tend to accumulate more debt over time and become more highly levered. Hence,\nHarris and Raviv argue that the pecking order predicts that bTo0: This is not the\nconventional prediction regarding the role of tangibility. A more common idea is\nbased on the hypothesis that collateral supports debt. It is often suggested that\ntangible assets naturally serve as collateral. Hence, collateral is associated with\nincreased leverage. The usual prediction is that bT > 0:\nFirms with high market-to-book ratios are often thought to have more future\ngrowth opportunities. As in Myers (1977), there may be a concern that debt could\nlimit a ﬁrm’s ability to seize such opportunities when they appear. Goyal et al. (2002)\nﬁnd that when growth opportunities of defense ﬁrms decline, these ﬁrms increase\ntheir use of debt ﬁnancing. Barclay et al. (2001) present a model showing that the\ndebt capacity of growth options can be negative. The common prediction is that\nbMTBo0:\nLarge ﬁrms are usually more diversiﬁed, have better reputations in debt markets,\nand face lower information costs when borrowing. Therefore, large ﬁrms are\npredicted to have more debt in their capital structures. The prediction is that bLS > 0:\nThe predictions on proﬁtability are ambiguous. The tradeoff theory predicts that\nproﬁtable ﬁrms should be more highly levered to offset corporate taxes. Also, in\nmany asymmetric information models, such as Ross (1977), proﬁtable ﬁrms are\npredicted to have higher leverage. But Titman and Wessels (1988) and Fama and\nFrench (2002) show that this is not a common ﬁnding. Instead, the literature ﬁnds\nproﬁts and leverage to be negatively correlated. While MacKay and Phillips (2001)\nchallenge this common ﬁnding, we expect to ﬁnd that bPo0:\nM.Z. Frank, V.K. Goyal / Journal of Financial Economics 67 (2003) 217–248\n224\nFama and French (2002) note that the negative relationship between proﬁts and\nleverage is consistent with the pecking order theory. But the pecking order is not the\nonly possible interpretation of the relationship. There are at least two issues. First,\ncurrent proﬁtability can also serve as a signal of investment opportunities. There is a\nlarge macro-ﬁnance literature, including studies by Gilchrist and Himmelberg (1995)\nand Kaplan and Zingales (1997), in which this interpretation issue plays a key role. It\nis well known that it is difﬁcult to construct a convincing proxy for investment\nopportunities. If Tobin’s q or the simpler measure, market-to-book assets, is\nmeasured with error, then it may not adequately control for the information content\nin a ﬁrm’s proﬁtability. For an analysis of measurement error in this context, see\nErickson and Whited (2000).\nThe second issue is that ﬁrms may face ﬁxed costs of adjustment. Fischer et al.\n(1989) analyze the effect of having ﬁxed costs associated with actively adjusting\nleverage. When a ﬁrm earns proﬁts, debt gets paid off and leverage falls\nautomatically. Only periodically will large readjustments be made in order to\ncapture the tax beneﬁts of leverage. Empirically, most of the data reﬂects the process\nof paying off the debt by using proﬁts. Thus, proﬁtable ﬁrms will be less levered even\nif the tradeoff theory is at work and the adjustment costs are taken into account.\n3. Data\nWe need the data from funds ﬂow statements to test the pecking order theory. This\nrestricts the beginning of the sample period to 1971 since that is when American\nﬁrms started reporting funds ﬂow statements. The data ends with 1998. Variables are\ndeﬂated to constant 1992 dollars.\nFollowing standard practice, ﬁnancial ﬁrms (6000–6999), regulated utilities (4900–\n4999), and ﬁrms involved in major mergers (Compustat footnote code AB) are\nexcluded.2 Also excluded are ﬁrms with missing book value of assets and a small\nnumber of ﬁrms that reported format codes 4, 5, or 6. Compustat does not deﬁne\nformat codes 4 and 6. Format code 5 is for the Canadian ﬁle. The balance sheet and\ncash ﬂow statement variables as a percentage of assets are trimmed to remove the\nmost extreme 0.50% in either tail of the distribution. This serves to remove outliers\nand the most extremely misrecorded data.3\nThe balance sheet presentation of corporate assets and liabilities is reasonably\nconsistent over time. Average common-size balance sheets for a number of years\nbetween 1971 and 1998 are presented in Table 1. The asset side shows signiﬁcant\nchanges over time. Cash increases dramatically over the period, going from 5% to\n2Leaving in the data on ﬁrms involved in major mergers had no material effect on our conclusions. We,\ntherefore, do not report these results separately.\n3Prior to trimming, several balance sheet and cash ﬂow statement items are recoded as zero if they were\nreported missing or combined with other data items in Compustat. The data is often coded as missing\nwhen a ﬁrm does not report a particular item or combines it with other data items. After examining\naccounting identities, we determine that recoding missing values on these items as zero respects the\nreported accounting identities.\nM.Z. Frank, V.K.

Financial ﬁrms and utilities are excluded. The value of each balance-sheet\nitem is calculated as a percentage of the book value of total assets and then averaged across each ﬁrm reporting data on Compustat in that year. When ﬁrms\nreport combined cash and short-term investments, we include these amounts with cash and recode short-term investments as zero. In addition, the following\nitems are recoded as zero when they were either missing or combined with other data items: investment and advances (#31 and #32), intangibles (#33), other\nassets (#69), debt in current liabilities (#34), income taxes payable (#71), other current liabilities (#72), other liabilities (#75), deferred taxes and ITC (#35), and\nminority interest (#38).\nAverage balance sheet item as a fraction of total assets\nYear\n1971\n1975\n1980\n1985\n1990\n1995\n1998\nNumber of observations\n2,833\n4,889\n4,639\n5,305\n5,243\n7,368\n7,301\nAssets:\n+Cash (#162)\n0.053\n0.054\n0.052\n0.083\n0.098\n0.120\n0.135\n+Short-term investment (#193)\n0.041\n0.042\n0.051\n0.051\n0.030\n0.043\n0.048\n+Receivables—total (#2)\n0.197\n0.206\n0.213\n0.193\n0.190\n0.188\n0.177\n+Inventories—total (#3)\n0.239\n0.241\n0.220\n0.179\n0.166\n0.143\n0.122\n+Current assets—other (#68)\n0.015\n0.017\n0.019\n0.023\n0.026\n0.032\n0.033\n=Current assets—total (#4)\n0.548\n0.567\n0.566\n0.543\n0.525\n0.542\n0.532\n+Net property, plant, and equipment—total (#8)\n0.351\n0.342\n0.351\n0.345\n0.330\n0.300\n0.282\n+Investments and advances—equity method (#31)\n0.014\n0.011\n0.011\n0.011\n0.009\n0.007\n0.007\n+Investment and advances—other (#32)\n0.022\n0.021\n0.022\n0.025\n0.021\n0.020\n0.018\n+Intangibles (#33)\n0.034\n0.030\n0.020\n0.029\n0.049\n0.056\n0.076\n+Assets—other (#69)\n0.026\n0.022\n0.024\n0.035\n0.049\n0.055\n0.059\n=Total assets (#6)\n1.000\n1.000\n1.000\n1.000\n1.000\n1.000\n1.000\nM.Z.

Intangibles double from 3.4% to 7.6% of the total assets.\nAt the same time, inventories, and property, plant, and equipment experience large\ndeclines. In contrast to the assets side of the balance sheet, the liability side is quite\nstable during this period.\nAmerican ﬁrms report their accounts in a number of different formats over the last\nthirty years. To have a consistent time-series, we merge the different format codes to\na common format. The data from 1971 to 1987 is from the ‘‘Cash Statement by\nSources and Use of funds.’’ The standard form of reporting corporate cash ﬂows\nchanged in 1988. For ﬁscal years ending before July 15, 1988, there are three distinct\nbut closely related formats (Compustat format codes 1, 2, 3) that were permitted for\ncompanies to report their cash ﬂows. Beginning in 1988, most ﬁrms start reporting\nStatement of Cash Flows (format code 7). In the earlier period, the structure has\nfunds from operations plus other sources of funds minus uses of working capital\nequals change in working capital. The cash ﬂows since July 15, 1988 are structured as\nincome plus indirect operating activities plus investing activities plus ﬁnancing\nactivities equals change in cash and cash equivalents. A disaggregated version of\nthese statements is fairly lengthy and is therefore relegated to Appendix A. The fact\nthat this statement is lengthy is itself important to recognize. It implies that when\ntesting the pecking order, a large number of separate elements are being aggregated.\nIt has been suggested that the pecking order hypothesis must be true empirically.\nThis is because it is ‘‘well known’’ that, to a ﬁrst approximation, ﬁrms do not issue\nmuch equity after the IPO. If equity issues are known to be zero, then by the\naccounting identity in Eq. (1), the ﬁnancing deﬁcit must be equal to the debt issue.\nAs shown in Table 2, this conjectured ﬁrst approximation to an accounting identity\nis misleading. Much more equity is issued than is sometimes recognized.\nTable 2 presents cash ﬂows in an aggregated form that matches Eq. (1). In this\ntable, the ﬁnancing deﬁcit grows over time. To a dramatic degree, net equity issues\ngrow at a faster rate than net debt issues. The number of public ﬁrms grows\nsigniﬁcantly over the period studied. Therefore, an obvious hypothesis is that the\nmagnitude of equity reﬂects a large number of IPOs. To check this, we remove the\ndata for each ﬁrm for the ﬁrst year that it appeared in Compustat. The results (not\nreported) show that removing these observations has only a minor effect. The large\nuse of net equity is not merely an IPO effect.\nFirm size and discreteness both play a role in understanding the evidence in Table\n2. During the 1980s and especially the 1990s, a signiﬁcant inﬂux of small ﬁrms\nbecame publicly traded. These small ﬁrms use relatively more equity ﬁnancing than\ndo large ﬁrms. Table 2 reports the mean values. Due to discreteness, there is a big\ngap between the mean and the median debt and equity issues. The median net debt\nissue and the median net equity issue are both close to zero despite the large mean\nvalues. Apparently many ﬁrms remain out of both the debt and equity markets most\nof the time. Occasionally, they enter these markets actively. The magnitudes of the\ninterventions are often large relative to the ﬁrm size.\nWhile the tables provide snapshots in selected years, it is also helpful to consider\nthe year-by-year trends in the relative use of debt and equity.

Frank, V.K. Goyal / Journal of Financial Economics 67 (2003) 217–248\n229\nfor the full 1971–1998 period. Because of the accounting cash ﬂow identity, it is\nnatural to expect that net debt and net equity ought to track the ﬁnancing deﬁcit.\nUnder the pecking order, one would expect that the debt would track the ﬁnancing\ndeﬁcit much more closely than would net equity. Empirically, the reverse is observed.\nAdding the currently maturing debt to the ﬁnancing deﬁcit and omitting IPO ﬁrms\nhave only very minor impacts on the picture. The correlation between net equity and\nthe ﬁnancing deﬁcit is 0.80, while the correlation between the ﬁnancing deﬁcit and\nnet long-term debt is only 0.48.\nThe information reported in Table 2 and depicted in Fig. 1 conveys an important\nmessage. According to Myers (2001) a major advantage of the pecking order is that it\nexplains why the bulk of external ﬁnancing takes the form of debt. What Table 2\nshows is that this is empirically not observed. A great deal of external ﬁnancing takes\nthe form of equity. Graham (2000) shows that some ﬁrms use debt conservatively\nand that these ﬁrms employ more equity than debt. The low debt levels employed by\nsome ﬁrms remain theoretically challenging.

The ﬁgure plots annual averages of the ratios of ﬁnancing deﬁcit to net assets, net debt\nissued to net assets, and net equity issued to net assets for the period between 1971 and 1998. The sample\ncomprises U.S. ﬁrms on the Compustat ﬁles. Financial ﬁrms and regulated utilities are excluded. The\nﬁnancing deﬁcit is calculated as cash dividends plus investments plus change in working capital minus\ninternal cash ﬂow. Net debt issued is long-term debt issuance minus long-term debt redemption. Net equity\nissued is the issue of stock minus the repurchase of stock. The variables are constructed using data from\nCompustat funds-ﬂow statements.\nM.Z. Frank, V.K. Goyal / Journal of Financial Economics 67 (2003) 217–248\n230\nLemmon and Zender (2001) provide further evidence. In many years more equity\nthan debt is used on average.\nA second important aspect of Table 2 concerns the importance of retained\nearnings relative to external ﬁnancing. According to Myers (2001), typically most\ninvestment is ﬁnanced by internal cash ﬂow. Table 2 shows that during the 1980s and\n1990s, this is not the typical pattern. Over time, the internal cash ﬂow declines in\nrelative importance as a source of ﬁnancing.\n4. Empirical tests\nShyam-Sunder and Myers (1999) study data from the period 1971 to 1989. Results\nare presented separately for their sample period (1971–1989) and for subsequent\nyears (1990–1998) for many speciﬁcations. This facilitates comparisons.\nTable 3 provides the results of regressions for the same time period as Shyam-\nSunder and Myers (1999). We follow their approach of reporting results separately\nfor net debt issued, gross debt issued, and the change in the debt ratio. We also\nattempt to match their sample selection criteria. The most signiﬁcant of their criteria\nis the requirement that ﬁrms report continuously on the necessary variables. These\ncriteria result in a sample with 768 ﬁrms and 19 years of data for each ﬁrm. This is\nsigniﬁcantly larger than their sample of 157 ﬁrms.\nMany other restrictions are tried. Examples include requiring ﬁrms to report\ncontinuously on a variety of other variables or only considering ﬁrms for inclusion\nbased on speciﬁc Compustat format codes. Adding more restrictions does result in\nsample sizes becoming smaller. However, we did not manage to exactly identify their\n157 ﬁrms. These further restrictions lead to samples for which the empirical results\nare very similar to those reported in Table 3. We therefore place minimum\nrestrictions consistent with our understanding of the treatment of data in their paper.\nThe results in Table 3 start with net debt issued as the dependent variable in a\nsample of ﬁrms with no gaps permitted. Despite the differences in sample size, we do\nreplicate the coefﬁcients on the ﬁnancing deﬁcit reported by Shyam-Sunder and\nMyers (1999). As reported in column (1) of Table 3, the estimated coefﬁcient for this\nsample is 0.75 and the R2 is 0.71. Support for the pecking order theory is strong in\nthis case. The ﬁndings for gross debt and change in debt ratio departs somewhat\nfrom their results.\nFor the holdout sample R2s, there is a choice of whether to use the same restricted\nset of ﬁrms or instead to examine the broader population of ﬁrms. It is not a case of\none being right and the other being wrong. These two alternatives provide different\ninformation about what the ﬁtted equation tells us. The full sample holdout test\nshows whether the ﬁtted model accounts for the broad population of ﬁrms that exist\nover the subsequent ﬁve years. The restricted sample holdout test shows whether the\nﬁtted model accounts for the debt issuing decisions of the surviving members of the\nselected sample over the next ﬁve years. The attrition rate among the selected sample\nof ﬁrms is rather high in the next ﬁve years. For the survivors, the predictability is\nvery good. Of course, the pecking order theory does not predict which ﬁrms will\nM.Z. Frank, V.K.

The full\npopulation out-of-sample results show that the model results do not generalize.\nThere is nothing in the pecking order theory that requires the use of balanced\npanels of ﬁrms. Comparison of columns (1)–(3) with columns (4)–(6) shows that\nrequiring ﬁrms to have no reporting gaps has a nontrivial impact on the results. Both\nthe estimated coefﬁcient on the ﬁnancing deﬁcit, and the R2; decline sharply when we\nexamine the broader population of U.S. ﬁrms over the period 1971–1989. As column\n(4) of Table 3 shows, the coefﬁcient on ﬁnancing deﬁcit in the net debt issued\nregression is 0.28 with an R2 of 0.27. The results from regressions that explain gross\ndebt issued and change in debt ratio as a function of ﬁnancing deﬁcit similarly show\nsubstantial declines in both coefﬁcient estimates and R2s when the focus shifts from\nthe 768 ﬁrm sample that traded continuously to the broader population of publicly\ntraded U.S. ﬁrms.4\nHow did the ﬁrms with no gaps in the reporting of funds ﬂow data differ from the\nbroader population? The 768 ﬁrms that reported continuously during 1971–1989\nwere large. Their book value of assets is almost twice that of the broader population\nof ﬁrms. These ﬁrms also issue signiﬁcantly higher amounts of debt and signiﬁcantly\nlower amounts of equity. The R2 on the hold out samples show that ﬁtted equations\nfrom the period 1971–1989 have a very limited ability to forecast leverage behavior\nduring the next ﬁve years.\nAre the results speciﬁc to a particular time period? To address this question,\nTable 4 uses the data from the 1990s and initially requires the included ﬁrms to report\ncontinuous data on the ﬂow of funds. We then relax the continuous reporting criteria\nto examine whether the results are sensitive to the period, the requirement that ﬁrms\nreport continuous funds ﬂow data or both. The coefﬁcient estimates and the R2s are\nnow uniformly lower, even when we require that ﬁrms have no reporting gaps.\nDuring 1990–1998 the no-reporting-gap ﬁrms were large equity issuers. The\naverage ratio of net equity issued to net assets was 0.033 and the average ratio of net\ndebt issued over net assets was 0.008. Thus, we see that time period plays a major\nrole. Comparing Table 3 to Table 4 shows that support for the pecking order theory\nwas weaker in the 1990s.\n4.1. Disaggregating the ﬁnancing deﬁcit\nThe aggregation step embodied in the pecking order is a nontrivial imposition of\nstructure on the data. Is that structure justiﬁed empirically? Table 5 reports\ndisaggregated deﬁcit component regressions for the earlier period.\n4We tried a great many additional variations to see if greater support could be found for the pecking\norder theory. To save space, we do not report the details of most of these variations. We tried different\nways of constructing the deﬁcit variable. We experimented with including current maturities of long-term\ndebt at the beginning of period to the deﬁcit variable. We also experimented with excluding changes in\ncash and changes in current debt from the change in working capital. In every case, the magnitude of the\nestimated coefﬁcient and the R2 appeared marginally worse, without affecting our overall conclusion. We\nalso examined a simple deﬁcit variable that excludes extraordinary and non-operating ﬂows. As expected,\nthe estimated coefﬁcients and R2s worsen signiﬁcantly.\nM.Z. Frank, V.K.

Frank, V.K. Goyal / Journal of Financial Economics 67 (2003) 217–248\n235\nColumn (1) in Table 5 is relatively supportive of the pecking order aggrega-\ntion step. If this column is examined in isolation, one could conclude that the\nevidence, while rejecting aggregation, is actually reasonably favorable to the theory.\nHowever, this result is a function of the requirement that ﬁrms have no gaps in funds\nﬂow data over the entire period from 1971 to 1989. When we include ﬁrms that do\nnot have complete records (in columns (4)–(7)), the sample becomes much larger and\nthe observed coefﬁcients change dramatically. During the 1990s, the evidence moves\nfurther away from supporting the pecking order aggregation hypothesis.\nHow should we interpret the coefﬁcients on the components of the ﬁnancing\ndeﬁcit? We start with cash dividends. Table 5 shows that when net debt issues are\nconsidered the coefﬁcient on cash dividends is positive, but when gross debt issues\nare considered it is negative. This stems from the fact that dividend-paying ﬁrms\nissue less long-term debt but they also redeem less when compared to non-dividend\npaying ﬁrms. It is worth noting that the tradeoff theory also predicts a positive\nrelation between dividends and debt. High dividend paying ﬁrms are likely to be\nthose that expect to continue to generate large cash ﬂows and have small investment\nneeds in relation to cash ﬂows.\nThe pecking order theory predicts a positive sign and a unit coefﬁcient on\ninvestments in both ﬁxed assets and working capital. According to the theory, after\ncontrolling for internal cash ﬂows, investments in ﬁxed assets and working capital\nshould be matched dollar for dollar by increases in debt issues. But this is not the\nonly idea. The tradeoff theory also predicts a positive relation between investments\nand debt. Higher investments add to assets in place, increasing tangible assets. This\nincreases debt capacity. The positive relation between changes in working capital\nand net debt issues might also reﬂect timing issues. If a ﬁrm issues long-term debt\nthen it receives cash. Until the ﬁrm spends that cash, it can be put into bank accounts\nor other short-term investments that are included in working capital.\nAt the typical ﬁrm, internal cash ﬂow does lead to some reduction in debt issues,\nbut the magnitude of the effect is surprisingly small once one includes the behavior of\nﬁrms that do not have complete trading records. There is a large literature showing a\nnegative relation between leverage and proﬁtability. However, as noted earlier, if\ninternal cash ﬂow measures future growth opportunities, then the tradeoff theory\nalso predicts the observed negative relation on cash ﬂows.\nIn column (7) of Table 5, the current portion of long-term debt is added as a\nfurther explanatory variable. As previously discussed, Shyam-Sunder and Myers\n(1999) include the current portion of long-term debt as a component of the ﬁnancing\ndeﬁcit. The ﬁnancing deﬁcit variable studied in this paper does not include it.\nColumn (7) illustrates why it was dropped. The sign is negative and the magnitude is\nfairly small. This is not at all what is predicted by the pecking order theory. This\nevidence is consistent with a model in which transaction costs play a signiﬁcant role.\nWhen long-term debt comes due, it is not automatically replaced with new debt.\n4.2. A priori selection criteria for pecking order ﬁrms\nThe evidence presented so far has shown that the pecking order theory does not\naccount for the broad patterns in the ﬁnancing of American ﬁrms. This does not rule\nM.Z. Frank, V.K. Goyal / Journal of Financial Economics 67 (2003) 217–248\n236\nout the possibility that some ﬁrms have the hypothesized unit slope coefﬁcient in\nEq. (2). The theory suggests looking for ﬁrms prone to adverse selection problems.\nTable 3 suggests looking at large ﬁrms.\nThe pecking order theory is based on a difference of information between\ncorporate insiders and the market. The driving force is adverse selection.\nAccordingly, it is natural to examine ﬁrms that are commonly thought to be\nparticularly subject to adverse selection problems, such as small ﬁrms and high-\ngrowth ﬁrms. Table 6 shows that the evidence strongly rejects this hypothesis. The\npecking order performs much worse for these ﬁrms. This evidence is consistent with\nHelwege and Liang (1996), who study a sample of ﬁrms that had an IPO in 1983, and\nthus were fairly small on average. Helwege and Liang (1996) ﬁnd that the use of\nexternal ﬁnancing by these ﬁrms did not match the pecking order prediction.\nSince small ﬁrms do not generally follow the pecking order, consideration next\nturns to large ﬁrms. Consideration is also given to ﬁrms that are likely to have less\nsevere adverse selection problems, such as ﬁrms paying dividends and ﬁrms with\nmoderate leverage. The results show that the pecking order theory does in fact\nperform much better for large ﬁrms. Neither moderate leverage nor the payment of\ndividends substitutes for the effect of ﬁrm size.\nThis evidence shows that ﬁrm size is critical.5 There is a monotonic improvement\nof the performance of the pecking order predictions as the ﬁrm size increases. For the\nlargest quartile, there is reasonable support for the pecking order prediction. For the\nsmallest set of ﬁrms, the pecking order is rejected. In the middle, the support for the\ntheory grows with ﬁrm size.\nOverall, the results based on data from the period 1971–1989 show that the\nsmallest ﬁrms do not follow the pecking order, but the largest ﬁrms do, and the\nmedium size categories are somewhat pecking order-like over this time period. There\nis strong evidence that at least some aspects of the ﬁnancing patterns have changed\nover time. Does this have an effect on the interpretation of the role of ﬁrm size?\nThe last four columns of Table 6 provide evidence from the period 1990–1998.\nSupport for the pecking order declines signiﬁcantly. During the 1990s, it is only the\ntop quartile of ﬁrms that are at all supportive. Even for the top quartile of ﬁrms, the\nnumerical coefﬁcients move further from the pecking order predictions. In columns\n(5) and (6) the holdout sample predictions are considerably poorer than the in\nsample R2 would suggest. This is consistent with the evidence in columns (9) and (10)\nshowing that corporate-debt-issuing behavior changes during the 1990s. This shows\nthat, in addition to ﬁrm size, the time period also matters for the tests of the pecking\norder. Large ﬁrms in earlier decades are most supportive of the pecking order theory,\nwhile smaller, high-growth ﬁrms provide the strongest rejections of the theory.\nSupport for pecking order declines even for larger ﬁrms in the 1990s.\nThe results on large ﬁrms match well with the results from the survey of ﬁnancial\nmanagers carried out by Graham and Harvey (2001). They report that some\n5We treat ﬁrm size as exogenous. This is quite common in corporate ﬁnance studies. Of course, there is a\ndeeper level of consideration at which ﬁrm size itself might be explained. Kumar et al. (2001) study some\naspects of this question.\nM.Z. Frank, V.K.

Conventional leverage regressions\nEven if a theory is wrong, it could still be helpful if it does a better job of\naccounting for the evidence than competing theories. The pecking order is a\ncompetitor to more conventional empirical leverage speciﬁcations. Accordingly, the\nnext test of the theory is to see how the ﬁnancing deﬁcit works when added to a\nconventional leverage regression. To provide a suitable structure to nest both the\npecking order theory and the conventional variables, the regressions are run in ﬁrst\ndifferences. As explained in Section 2.2, ﬁrst differences can bias the conventional\nvariables towards zero. The dependent variable in these regressions is the change in\nmarket leverage. Using book leverage yields similar results.\nTable 7 presents the results. The estimated coefﬁcients on the market-to-book\nassets ratio, tangibility, ﬁrm size, and proﬁtability have the usual signs. The\ncoefﬁcient signs are negative on the market-to-book ratio, positive on tangibility,\npositive on log of sales, and negative on proﬁtability.\nIn column (2), the leverage regression is estimated with ﬁnancing deﬁcit as an\nadditional explanatory variable. If the pecking order were the key driver, it should\nhave wiped out the effects of the conventional variables. It did not do so. Adding the\ndeﬁcit variable to the regression did not have much effect on the magnitudes and\nsigniﬁcance of the coefﬁcients on the conventional variables. However, the ﬁnancing\ndeﬁcit is empirically relevant.\nIn column (3), the leverage regressions are re-estimated with lagged leverage as an\nadditional explanatory variable. The coefﬁcient on lagged leverage is fairly large in\nmagnitude and statistically signiﬁcant. The negative sign on lagged leverage suggests\nthat mean reversion is at work as predicted by the tradeoff theory. Inclusion of\nlagged leverage does not affect the sign and signiﬁcance of most of the other\nvariables in the regression.\nWhile the pecking order theory is rejected, this does not mean that the ﬁnancing\ndeﬁcit is ignored. As shown in columns (4)–(9), the information contained in the\nﬁnancing deﬁcit appears to be factored in, along with many other considerations,\nparticularly when large ﬁrms adjust leverage. But as shown in column (8) of Table 7,\neven for the largest set of ﬁrms, it is easy to reject the hypothesized unit coefﬁcient on\nthe ﬁnancing deﬁcit.\nIt is interesting to consider the R2 on the hold out samples. Adding the ﬁnancing\ndeﬁcit and adding lagged leverage adds remarkably little to the performance of the\nﬁtted equations once account is taken of the conventional factors. This is consistent\nwith Fama and French (2002) who argue that mean reversion in corporate leverage is\nsurprisingly weak.\nMost studies report on levels of leverage rather than on changes in leverage.\nAccordingly, for completeness, we also estimate analogous regressions run in levels.\nThe results (omitted in order to save space) show that the cumulative ﬁnancing\ndeﬁcit added about 1% to the explanatory power of the regressions.

In this case, lagged leverage is signiﬁcant and has a positive\nsign. It also has a signiﬁcant impact both within sample and in the hold out sample.\n5. Conclusions\nThe pecking order theory is tested on a broad cross-section of publicly traded\nAmerican ﬁrms over the period 1971–1998. In contrast to what is often suggested,\ninternal ﬁnancing is not sufﬁcient to cover investment spending on average. External\nﬁnancing is heavily used. Debt ﬁnancing does not dominate equity ﬁnancing in\nmagnitude. Net equity issues track the ﬁnancing deﬁcit quite closely, while net debt does\nnot do so. The current portion of long-term debt is not treated as part of the ﬁnancing\ndeﬁcit. These facts are surprising from the perspective of the pecking order theory.\nThe pecking order theory is a competitor to the conventional leverage regressions.\nIt is thus important to examine the relative importance of the two approaches. In\nspeciﬁcations that nest the two approaches, the ﬁnancing deﬁcit adds a small amount\nof extra explanatory power. But the ﬁnancing deﬁcit does not challenge the role of\nthe conventional leverage factors.\nWhen narrower samples of ﬁrms are considered the greatest support for the\npecking order is found among large ﬁrms in earlier years. Over time, support for the\npecking order declines for two reasons. More small ﬁrms are publicly traded during\nthe 1980s and 1990s than during the 1970s. Since small ﬁrms do not follow the\npecking order, the overall average moves further from the pecking order. However,\nthe time period effect is not entirely due to more small ﬁrms in the 1990s. Even when\nattention is restricted to the largest quartile of ﬁrms, support for the pecking order\ntheory declines over time. Equity becomes more important.\nMany aspects of the evidence pose serious problems for the pecking order. But this\ndoes not mean that the information contained in the ﬁnancing deﬁcit is completely\nirrelevant. The components of the ﬁnancing deﬁcit appear factored in to some\ndegree, particularly by large ﬁrms, when they adjust their leverage.\nAppendix A\nStatement of disaggregated cash ﬂows is given in Table 8.\nAppendix B\nData on economic variables are provided in Table 9.\nAppendix C\nPair-wise correlations among key variables is given in Table 10.\nM.Z.
