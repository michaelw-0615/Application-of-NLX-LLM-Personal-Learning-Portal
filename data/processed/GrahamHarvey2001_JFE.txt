1. Introduction
In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey that describes the current
practice of corporate "nance. Perhaps the best-known "eld study in this area is
John Lintner's (1956) path-breaking analysis of dividend policy. The results of
that study are still quoted today and have deeply a!ected the way that dividend
policy research is conducted. In many respects, our goals are similar to Lin-
tner's. We hope that researchers will use our results to develop new theories
} and potentially modify or abandon existing views. We also hope that practi-
tioners will learn from our analysis by noting how other "rms operate and by
identifying areas where academic recommendations have not been fully imple-
mented.
Our survey di!ers from previous surveys in a number of dimensions. First,
the scope of our survey is broad. We examine capital budgeting, cost of capital,
and capital structure. This allows us to link responses across areas. For example,
we investigate whether "rms that consider "nancial #exibility to be a capital
structure priority are also likely to value real options in capital budgeting
decisions. We explore each category in depth, asking more than 100 total
questions.
Second, we sample a large cross-section of approximately 4,440 "rms. In total,
392 chief "nancial o$cers responded to the survey, for a response rate of 9%.
The next largest survey that we know of is Moore and Reichert (1983) who study
298 large "rms. We investigate for possible nonresponse bias and conclude that
our sample is representative of the population.

Third, we analyze the responses conditional on "rm characteristics. We
examine the relation between the executives' responses and "rm size, P/E ratio,
leverage, credit rating, dividend policy, industry, management ownership, CEO
age, CEO tenure, and the education of the CEO. By testing whether responses
di!er across these characteristics, we shed light on the implications of various
corporate "nance theories related to "rm size, risk, investment opportunities,
transaction costs, informational asymmetry, and managerial incentives. This
analysis allows for a deeper investigation of corporate "nance theories. For
example, we go beyond asking whether "rms follow a "nancial pecking order
(Myers and Majluf, 1984). We investigate whether the "rms that most strongly
support the implications of the pecking-order theory are also the "rms most
a!ected by informational asymmetries, as suggested by the theory.
Survey-based analysis complements other research based on large samples
and clinical studies. Large sample studies are the most common type of empiri-
cal analysis, and have several advantages over other approaches. Most large-
sample studies o!er, among other things, statistical power and cross-sectional
variation. However, large-sample studies often have weaknesses related to
variable speci"cation and the inability to ask qualitative questions. Clinical
studies are less common but o!er excellent detail and are unlikely to `average
awaya unique aspects of corporate behavior. However, clinical studies use small
samples and their results are often sample-speci"c.
The survey approach o!ers a balance between large sample analyses and
clinical studies. Our survey analysis is based on a moderately large sample and
a broad cross-section of "rms. At the same time, we are able to ask very speci"c
and qualitative questions. The survey approach is not without potential prob-
lems, however. Surveys measure beliefs and not necessarily actions. Survey
analysis faces the risk that the respondents are not representative of the popula-
tion of "rms, or that the survey questions are misunderstood. Overall, survey
analysis is seldom used in corporate "nancial research, so we feel that our paper
provides unique information to aid our understanding of how "rms operate.
The results of our survey are both reassuring and surprising. On one hand,
most "rms use present value techniques to evaluate new projects. On the other
hand, a large number of "rms use company-wide discount rates to evaluate these
projects rather than a project-speci"c discount rate. Interestingly, the survey
indicates that "rm size signi"cantly a!ects the practice of corporate "nance. For
example, large "rms are signi"cantly more likely to use net present value
techniques and the capital asset pricing model for project evaluation than are
small "rms, while small "rms are more likely to use the payback criterion.
A majority of large "rms have a tight or somewhat tight target debt ratio, in
contrast to only one-third of small "rms.
Executives rely heavily on practical, informal rules when choosing capital
structure. The most important factors a!ecting debt policy are "nancial #exibil-
ity and a good credit rating. When issuing equity, respondents are concerned

189
about earnings per share dilution and recent stock price appreciation. We "nd
very little evidence that executives are concerned about asset substitution,
asymmetric information, transactions costs, free cash #ows, or personal taxes.
We acknowledge but do not investigate the possibility that these deeper implica-
tions are, for example, impounded into prices and credit ratings, and so execu-
tives react to them indirectly.
The paper is organized as follows. In the second section, we present the survey
design, the sampling methodology, and discuss some caveats of survey research.
In the third section we study capital budgeting. We analyze the cost of capital in
the fourth section. In the "fth section we examine capital structure. We o!er
some concluding remarks in the "nal section.
2. Methodology
2.1. Design
Our survey focuses on three areas: capital budgeting, cost of capital, and
capital structure. Based on a careful review of the existing literature, we de-
veloped a draft survey that was circulated to a group of prominent academics for
feedback. We incorporated their suggestions and revised the survey. We then
sought the advice of marketing research experts on the survey design and
execution. We made changes to the format of the questions and overall survey
design with the goal of minimizing biases induced by the questionnaire and
maximizing the response rate.
The survey project is a joint e!ort with the Financial Executives Institute
(FEI). FEI has approximately 14,000 members that hold policy-making posi-
tions as CFOs, treasurers, and controllers at 8,000 companies throughout the
U.S. and Canada. Every quarter, Duke University and the FEI poll these
"nancial o$cers with a one-page survey on important topical issues (Graham,
1999b). The usual response rate for the quarterly survey is 8}10%.
Using the penultimate version of the survey, we conducted beta tests at both
FEI and Duke University. This involved having graduating MBA students and
"nancial executives "ll out the survey, note the required time, and provide
feedback. Our beta testers took, on average, 17 minutes to complete the survey.
Based on this and other feedback, we made "nal changes to the wording on
some questions. The "nal version of the survey contained 15 questions, most
with subparts, and was three pages long. One section collected demographic
information about the sample "rms.

ent versions with questions 11}14 and questions 1}4 interchanged. We were
concerned that the respondents might "ll in the "rst page or two of the survey
190

but leave the last page blank. If this were the case, we would expect to see
a higher proportion of respondents answering the questions that appear at the
beginning of either version of the survey. We "nd no evidence that the response
rate di!ers depending on whether the questions are at beginning or the end of
the survey.
2.2. Delivery and response
We used two mechanisms to deliver the survey. We sent a mailing from Duke
University on February 10, 1999 to each CFO in the 1998 Fortune 500 list.
Independently, the FEI faxed out 4,440 surveys to their member "rms on
February 16, 1999. Three hundred thirteen of the Fortune 500 CFOs belong to
the FEI, so these "rms received both a fax and a mailed version. We requested
that the surveys be returned by February 23, 1999. To encourage the executives
to respond, we o!ered an advanced copy of the results to interested parties.
We employed a team of 10 MBA students to follow up on the mailing to the
Fortune 500 "rms with a phone call and possible faxing of a second copy of the
survey. On February 23, FEI refaxed the survey to the 4,440 FEI corporations
and we remailed the survey to the Fortune 500 "rms, with a new due date of
February 26, 1999. This second stage was planned in advance and designed to
maximize the response rate.
The executives returned their completed surveys by fax to a third-party data
vendor. Using a third party ensures that the survey responses are anonymous.
We feel that anonymity is important to obtain frank answers to some of the
questions. Although we do not know the identity of the survey respondents, we
do know a number of "rm-speci"c characteristics, as discussed below.
Three hundred ninety-two completed surveys were returned, for a response
rate of nearly 9%. Given the length (three pages) and depth (over 100 questions)
of our survey, this response rate compares favorably to the response rate for the
quarterly FEI-Duke survey.The rate is also comparable to other recent aca-
demic surveys. For example, Trahan and Gitman (1995) obtain a 12% response
rate in a survey mailed to 700 CFOs. The response rate is higher (34%) in Block
(1999), but he targets Chartered Financial Analysts - not senior o$cers of
particular "rms.
2.3. Summary statistics and data issues
Fig. 1 presents summary information about the "rms in our sample. The
companies range from very small (26% of the sample "rms have sales of less
than $100 million) to very large (42% have sales of at least $1 billion) (see Fig.
1A). In subsequent analysis, we refer to "rms with revenues greater than $1
billion as `largea. Forty percent of the "rms are manufacturers (Fig. 1C). The
nonmanufacturing "rms are evenly spread across other industries, including

"nancial (15%), transportation and energy (13%), retail and wholesale sales
(11%), and high-tech (9%). In the appendix, we show that the responding "rms
are representative of the corporate population for size, industry, and other
characteristics.
The median price}earnings ratio is 15. Sixty percent of the respondents have
price}earnings ratios of 15 or greater (Fig. 1D). We refer to these "rms as growth

"rms when we analyze how investment opportunities a!ect corporate behavior.
We refer to the remaining 40% of the respondents as nongrowth "rms.
The distribution of debt levels is fairly uniform (Fig. 1E). Approximately
one-third of the sample "rms have debt-to-asset ratios below 20%, another third
have debt ratios between 20% and 40%, and the remaining "rms have debt
ratios greater than 40%. We refer to "rms with debt ratios greater than 30% as
J.R. Graham, C.R. Harvey / Journal of Financial Economics 60 (2001) 187}243
193
highly levered. The creditworthiness of the sample is also dispersed (Fig. 1F).
Twenty percent of the companies have credit ratings of AA or AAA, 32% have
an A credit rating, and 27% have a BBB rating. The remaining 21% have
speculative debt with ratings of BB or lower.
Though our survey respondents are CFOs, we ask a number of questions
about the characteristics of the chief executive o$cers. We assume that the
CFOs act as agents for the CEOs. Nearly half of the CEOs for the responding
"rms are between 50 and 59 years old (Fig. 1I). Another 23% are over age 59,
a group we refer to as `mature.a Twenty-eight percent of the CEOs are between
the ages of 40 and 49. The survey reveals that executives change jobs frequently.
Nearly 40% of the CEOs have been in their jobs less than four years, and
another 26% have been in their jobs between four and nine years (Fig. 1J). We
de"ne the 34% who have been in their jobs longer than nine years as having
`long tenurea. Forty-one percent of the CEOs have an undergraduate degree as
their highest level of educational attainment (Fig. 1K). Another 38% have an
MBA and 8% have a non-MBA masters degree. Finally, the top three executives
own at least 5% of the common stock of their "rm in 44% of the sample. These
CEO characteristics allow us to examine whether managerial incentives or
entrenchment a!ect the survey responses. We also study whether having an
MBA a!ects the choices made by corporate executives.
Fig. 1M shows that 36% of the sample "rms seriously considered issuing
common equity, 20% considered issuing convertible debt, and 31% thought
about issuing debt in foreign markets. Among responding "rms, 64% calculate
the cost of equity, 63% have publicly traded common stock, 53% issue divi-
dends, and 7% are regulated utilities (Fig. 1N). If issuing dividends is an
indication of a reduced informational disadvantage for investors relative to
managers (Sharpe and Nguyen, 1995), the dividend issuance dichotomy allows
us to examine whether the data support corporate theories based on informa-
tional asymmetry.
Table 1 presents correlations for the demographic variables. Not surprisingly,
small companies have lower credit ratings, a higher proportion of management
ownership, a lower incidence of paying dividends, a higher chance of being
privately owned, and a lower proportion of foreign revenue. Growth "rms are
likely to be small, have lower credit ratings, and have a higher degree of
management ownership. Firms that do not pay dividends have low credit
ratings.
Below, we perform univariate analyses on the survey responses conditional on
each separate "rm characteristic. However, because size is correlated with
a number of di!erent factors, we perform a robustness check for the nonsize
characteristics. We split the sample into large "rms versus small "rms. On each
size subsample, we repeat the analysis of the responses conditional on "rm
characteristics other than size. We generally only report the "ndings with
respect to nonsize characteristics if they hold on the full sample and the two size

195
subsamples. We also perform a separate robustness check relative to public
versus private "rms and only report the characteristic-based results if they hold
for the full and public samples. The tables contain the full set of results, including
those that do not pass these robustness checks.
All in all, the variation in executive and "rm characteristics permits a rich
description of the practice of corporate "nance, and allows us to infer whether
corporate actions are consistent with academic theories. We show in the appen-
dix that our sample is representative of the population from which it was drawn,
fairly representative of Compustat "rms, and not adversely a!ected by non-
response bias.
3. Capital budgeting methods
3.1. Design
This section studies how "rms evaluate projects. Previous surveys mainly
focus on large "rms and suggest that internal rate of return (IRR) is the primary
method for evaluation. For example, Gitman and Forrester (1977), in their
survey of 103 large "rms, "nd that only 9.8% of "rms use net present value as
their primary method and 53.6% report IRR as primary method. Stanley and
Block (1984) "nd that 65% of respondents report IRR as their primary capital
budgeting technique. Moore and Reichert (1983) survey 298 Fortune 500 "rms
and "nd that 86% use some type of discounted cash #ow analysis. Bierman
(1993) "nds that 73 of 74 Fortune 100 "rms use some type of discounted cash
#ow analysis. These results are similar to the "ndings in Trahan and Gitman
(1995), who survey 84 Fortune 500 and Forbes 200 best small companies, and
Bruner et al. (1998), who interview 27 highly regarded corporations. (See
http://www.duke.edu/&charvey/Research/indexr.htmfor a review of the capital
budgeting literature.)
Our survey di!ers from previous work in several ways. The most obvious
di!erence is that previous work almost exclusively focuses on the largest "rms.
Second, given that our sample is larger than all previous surveys, we are able to
control for many di!erent "rm characteristics. Finally, we go beyond NPV
versus IRR analysis and ask whether "rms use the following evaluation tech-
niques: adjusted present value (see Brealey and Myers, 1996), payback period,
discounted payback period, pro"tability index, and accounting rate of return.
We also inquire whether "rms bypass discounting techniques and simply use
earnings multiples. A price-earnings approach can be thought of as measuring
the number of years it takes for the stock price to be paid for by earnings, and
therefore can be interpreted as a version of the payback method. We are also
interested in whether "rms use other types of analyses that are taught in many
MBA programs, such as simulation analysis and value at risk (VaR). Finally, we

Fig. 2. Survey evidence on the popularity of di!erent capital budgeting methods. We report the
percentage of CFOs who always or almost always use a particular technique. IRR represents
internal rate of return, NPV is net present value, P/E is the price-to-earnings ratio, and APV is
adjusted present value. The survey is based on the responses of 392 CFOs.
are interested in the importance of real options in project evaluation (see Myers,
1977).
3.2. Results
Respondents are asked to score how frequently they use the di!erent capital
budgeting techniques on a scale of 0 to 4 (0 meaning `nevera, 4 meaning
`alwaysa). In many respects, the results di!er from previous surveys, perhaps
because we have a more diverse sample. An important caveat here, and through-
out the survey, is that the responses represent beliefs. We have no way of
verifying that the beliefs coincide with actions.
Most respondents select net present value and internal rate of return as their
most frequently used capital budgeting techniques (see Table 2); 74.9% of CFOs
always or almost always (responses of 4 and 3) use net present value (rating of
3.08); and 75.7% always or almost always use internal rate of return (rating of
3.09). The hurdle rate is also popular. These results are summarized in Fig. 2.
The most interesting results come from examining the responses conditional
on "rm and executive characteristics. Large "rms are signi"cantly more likely to
use NPV than small "rms (rating of 3.42 versus 2.83). There is no di!erence in
techniques used by growth and nongrowth "rms. Highly levered "rms are
signi"cantly more likely to use NPV and IRR than are "rms with small debt

ratios. This is not just an artifact of "rm size. In unreported analysis, we "nd
a signi"cant di!erence between high- and low-leverage small "rms as well as
high- and low-leverage large "rms. Interestingly, highly levered "rms are also
more likely to use sensitivity and simulation analysis. Perhaps because of
regulatory requirements, utilities are more likely to use IRR and NPV and
perform sensitivity and simulation analyses. We also "nd that CEOs with MBAs
are more likely than non-MBA CEOs to use net present value, but the di!erence
is only signi"cant at the 10% level.
Firms that pay dividends are signi"cantly more likely to use NPV and IRR
than are "rms that do not pay dividends. This result is also robust to our analysis by
size. Public companies are signi"cantly more likely to use NPV and IRR than are
private corporations. As the correlation analysis indicates in Table 1, many of these
attributes are correlated. For example, private corporations are also smaller "rms.
Other than NPV and IRR, the payback period is the most frequently used
capital budgeting technique (rating of 2.53). This is surprising because "nancial
textbooks have lamented the shortcomings of the payback criterion for decades.
(Payback ignores the time value of money and cash #ows beyond the cuto! date;
the cuto! is usually arbitrary.) Small "rms use the payback period (rating of
2.72) almost as frequently as they use NPV or IRR. In untabulated analysis, we
"nd that among small "rms, CEOs without MBAs are more likely to use the
payback criterion. The payback is most popular among mature CEOs (rating of
2.83). In separate examinations of small and large "rms, we "nd that mature
CEOs use payback signi"cantly more often than younger CEOs. Payback is
also frequently used by CEOs with long tenure (rating of 2.80). Few "rms use the
discounted payback (rating of 1.56), a method that eliminates one of the payback
criterion's de"ciencies by accounting for the time value of money.
It is sometimes argued that the payback approach is rational for severely
capital constrained "rms: if an investment project does not pay positive cash
#ows early on, the "rm will cease operations and therefore not receive positive
cash #ows that occur in the distant future, or else will not have the resources to
pursue other investments during the next few years (Weston and Brigham, 1981,
p. 405). We do not "nd any evidence to support this claim because we "nd no
relation between the use of payback and leverage, credit ratings, or dividend
policy. Our "nding that payback is used by older, longer-tenure CEOs without
MBAs instead suggests that lack of sophistication is a driving factor behind the
popularity of the payback criterion.
McDonald (1998) notes that rules of thumb such as payback and hurdle rates
can approximate optimal decision rules that account for the option-like features
of many investments, especially in the evaluation of very uncertain investments.
If small "rms have more volatile projects than do large "rms, this could explain
why small "rms use these ad hoc decision rules. It is even possible that small
"rms use these rules not because they realize that they approximate the optimal
rule but simply because the rules have worked in the past.

J.R. Graham, C.R. Harvey / Journal of Financial Economics 60 (2001) 187}243
A number of "rms use the earnings multiple approach for project evaluation.
There is weak evidence that large "rms are more likely to employ this approach
than are small "rms. We "nd that a "rm is signi"cantly more likely to use
earnings multiples if it is highly levered. The in#uence of leverage on the
earnings multiple approach is also robust across size (i.e., highly levered "rms,
whether they are large or small, frequently use earnings multiples).
In summary, compared to previous research, our results suggest increased
prominence of net present value as an evaluation technique. In addition, the
likelihood of using speci"c evaluation techniques is linked to "rm size, "rm
leverage, and CEO characteristics. In particular, small "rms are signi"cantly
less likely to use net present value. They are also less likely to use supple-
mentary sensitivity and VaR analyses. The next section takes this analysis one
step further by detailing the speci"c methods "rms use to obtain the cost of
capital, the most important risk factors, and a speci"c capital budgeting
scenario.
4. Cost of capital
4.1. Methodology
Our "rst task is to determine how "rms calculate the cost of equity capital.
We explore whether "rms use the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), a multi-
beta CAPM (with extra risk factors in addition to the market beta), average
historical returns, or a dividend discount model. The results in Table 3 and
summarized in Fig. 3 indicate that the CAPM is by far the most popular method
of estimating the cost of equity capital: 73.5% of respondents always or almost
always use the CAPM (rating of 2.92; see also Fig. 1H). The second and third
most popular methods are average stock returns and a multibeta CAPM,
respectively. Few "rms back the cost of equity out from a dividend discount
model (rating of 0.91). This sharply contrasts with the "ndings of Gitman
and Mercurio (1982) who survey 177 Fortune 1000 "rms and "nd that
only 29.9% of respondents use the CAPM `in some fashiona but "nd that
31.2% of the participants in their survey use a version of the dividend discount
model to establish their cost of capital. More recently, Bruner et al. (1998)
"nd that 85% of their 27 best-practice "rms use the CAPM or a modi"ed
CAPM. While the CAPM is popular, we show later that it is not clear that
the model is applied properly in practice. Of course, even if it is applied pro-
perly, it is not clear that the CAPM is a very good model (see Fama and French,
1992).
The cross-sectional analysis is particularly illuminating. Large "rms are much
more likely to use the CAPM than are small "rms (rating of 3.27 versus 2.49,
respectively). Smaller "rms are more inclined to use a cost of equity capital that

is determined by `what investors tell us they requirea. CEOs with MBAs are
more likely to use the single-factor CAPM or the CAPM with extra risk factors
than are non-MBA CEOs, but the di!erence is only signi"cant for the single-
factor CAPM.
We also "nd that "rms with low leverage or small management ownership are
signi"cantly more likely to use the CAPM. We "nd signi"cant di!erences for
private versus public "rms (public more likely to use the CAPM). This is perhaps
expected given that the beta of the private "rm could only be calculated via
analysis of comparable publicly traded "rms. Finally, we "nd that "rms with
high foreign sales are more likely to use the CAPM.
Given the sharp di!erence between large and small "rms, it is important to
check whether some of these control e!ects just proxy for size. It is, indeed, the
case that foreign sales proxy for size. Table 1 shows that that there is a signi"-
cant correlation between percent of foreign sales and size. When we analyze the
use of the CAPM by foreign sales controlling for size, we "nd no signi"cant
di!erences. However, this is not true for some of the other control variables.
There is a signi"cant di!erence in use of the CAPM across leverage that is
robust to size. The public/private e!ect is also robust to size. Finally, the
di!erence in the use of the CAPM based on management ownership holds for
small "rms but not for large "rms. That is, among small "rms, CAPM use is
inversely related to managerial ownership. There is no signi"cant relation for
larger "rms.

4.2. Specixc risk factors
Table 4 investigates sources of risk other than market risk, and how they are
treated in project evaluation. The list of risk factors includes the fundamental
factors in Fama and French (1992), and momentum as de"ned in Jegadeesh and
Titman (1993), as well as the macroeconomic factors in Chen et al. (1986) and
Ferson and Harvey (1991).
The format of Table 4 is di!erent from the others. We ask whether, in
response to these risk factors, the "rm modi"es its discount rate, cash #ows,
both, or neither. We report the percentage of respondents for each category. In
the cross-tabulations across each of the demographic factors, we test whether
the `neithera category is signi"cantly di!erent conditional on "rm character-
istics.
Overall, the most important additional risk factors are interest rate risk,
exchange rate risk, business cycle risk, and in#ation risk (see Fig. 4). For the
calculation of discount rates, the most important factors are interest rate risk,
size, in#ation risk, and foreign exchange rate risk. For the calculation of cash
#ows, many "rms incorporate the e!ects of commodity prices, GDP growth,
in#ation, and foreign exchange risk.
Interestingly, few "rms adjust either discount rates or cash #ows for book-to-
market, distress, or momentum risks. Only 13.1% of respondents consider the
book-to-market ratio in either the cash #ow or discount rate calculations.
Momentum is only considered important by 11.1% of the respondents.
Small and large "rms have di!erent priorities when adjusting for risk. For
large "rms, the most important risk factors (in addition to market risk) are
foreign exchange risk, business cycle risk, commodity price risk, and interest rate
risk. This closely corresponds to the set of factors detailed in Ferson and Harvey
(1993) in their large-sample study of multibeta international asset pricing mod-
els. Ferson and Harvey "nd that the most important additional factor is foreign
exchange risk. Table 4 shows that foreign exchange risk is by far the most
important nonmarket risk factor for large "rms (61.7% of the large "rms adjust
for foreign exchange risk; the next closest is 51.4% adjusting for business cycle
risk).
The ordering is di!erent for small "rms. Small "rms are more a!ected by
interest rate risk than they are by foreign exchange risk. This asymmetry in risk
exposure is consistent with the analysis of Jagannathan and Wang (1996) and
Jagannathan et al. (1998). They argue that small "rms are more likely to be
exposed to labor income risk and, as a result, we should expect to "nd these
"rms relying on a di!erent set of risk factors, and using the CAPM less
frequently, when estimating their cost of capital.
As might be expected, "rms with considerable foreign sales are sensitive to
unexpected exchange rate #uctuations. Fourteen percent of "rms with substan-
tial foreign exposure adjust discount rates for foreign exchange risk, 22% adjust

discount rates. We report the percentage of CFOs who always or almost always adjust for

cash #ows, and 32% adjust both. These "gures represent the highest incidence of
`adjusting somethinga for any type of non-market risk, for any demographic.
There are some interesting observations for the other control variables.
Highly levered "rms are more likely to consider business cycle risk important;
surprisingly, however, indebtedness does not a!ect whether "rms adjust for
interest rate risk, term structure risk, or distress risk. Growth "rms are much
more sensitive to foreign exchange risk than are nongrowth "rms. (Table 4 only
reports the results for four control variables; A full version of Table 4 is available
on the Internet at http://www.duke.edu/&charvey/Research/indexr.htm.)
4.3. Project versus xrm risk
Finally, we explore how the cost of equity models are used. In particular, we
consider an example of how a "rm evaluates a new project in an overseas
market. We are most interested in whether corporations consider the company-
wide risk or the project risk in evaluating the project.
Table 5 contains some surprising results. Remarkably, most "rms would use
a single company-wide discount rate to evaluate the project; 58.8% of the
respondents would always or almost always use the company-wide discount
rate, even though the hypothetical project would most likely have di!erent risk
characteristics. However, 51% of the "rms said they would always or almost

always use a risk-matched discount rate to evaluate this project. These results
are related to Bierman (1993) who "nds that 93% of the Fortune 100 industrial
"rms use the company-wide weighted average cost of capital for discounting,
72% use the rate applicable to the project based on the risk or the nature of the
project, and 35% use a rate based on the division's risk.
The reliance of many "rms on a company-wide discount rate might make
sense if these same "rms adjust cash #ows for foreign exchange risk when
considering risk factors (i.e., in Table 4). However in untabulated results, we "nd
the opposite: "rms that do not adjust cash #ows for foreign exchange risk are
also relatively less likely (compared to "rms that adjust for foreign exchange
risk) to use a risk-matched discount rate when evaluating an overseas project.
Large "rms are signi"cantly more likely to use the risk-matched discount rate
than are small "rms (rating of 2.34 versus 1.86). This is also con"rmed in our
analysis of Fortune 500 "rms, which are much more likely to use the risk-
matched discount rate than the "rm-wide discount rate to evaluate the foreign
project (rating of 2.61 versus 1.97). Very few "rms use a di!erent discount rate to
separately value di!erent cash #ows within the same project (rating of 0.66), as
Brealey and Myers (1996) suggest they should for cash #ows such as depreciation.
The analysis across "rm characteristics reveals some interesting patterns.
Growth "rms are more likely to use a company-wide discount rate to evaluate
projects. Surprisingly, "rms with foreign exposure are signi"cantly more likely
to use the company-wide discount rate to value an overseas project. Public
corporations are more likely to use a risk-matched discount rate than are
private corporations; however, this result is not robust to controlling for size.
CEOs with short tenures are more likely to use a company-wide discount rate
(signi"cant at the 5% level for both large and small "rms).
5. Capital structure
Our survey has separate questions about debt, equity, debt maturity, convert-
ible debt, foreign debt, target debt ratios, credit ratings, and actual debt ratios.
Instead of stepping through the responses security by security, this section
distills the most important "ndings from the capital structure questions and
presents the results grouped by theoretical hypothesis or concept. These group-
ings are neither mutually exclusive nor all-encompassing; they are intended
primarily to organize the exposition.
5.1. Trade-ow theory of capital structure choice
5.1.1. Target debt ratios and the costs and benexts of debt
One of the longest-standing questions about capital structure is whether "rms
have target debt ratios. The trade-o! theory says that "rms have optimal

209
Fig. 5. Survey evidence on some of the factors that a!ect the decision to issue debt. The survey is
based on the responses of 392 CFOs.
debt}equity ratios, which they determine by trading o! the bene"ts of debt with
the costs (e.g., Scott, 1976). In traditional trade-o! models, the chief bene"t of
debt is the tax advantage of interest deductibility (Modigliani and Miller, 1963).
The primary costs are those associated with "nancial distress and the personal
tax expense bondholders incur when they receive interest income (Miller, 1977).
In this section we discuss the traditional factors in the trade-o! theory, namely
distress costs and tax costs and bene"ts. Many additional factors (e.g., informa-
tional asymmetry, agency costs) can be modeled in a trade-o! framework. We
discuss these alternative costs and bene"ts in separate sections below.
Table 6 and Fig. 5 show the factors that determine the appropriate amount of
debt for the "rm. The CFOs tell us that the corporate tax advantage of debt is
moderately important in capital structure decisions: Row a of Table 6 shows
that the mean response is 2.07 on a scale from 0 to 4 (0 meaning not important, 4
meaning very important). The tax advantage is most important for large,
regulated, and dividend-paying "rms } companies that probably have high
corporate tax rates and therefore large tax incentives to use debt. Desai (1998)
shows that "rms issue foreign debt in response to relative tax incentives, so we
investigate whether "rms issue debt when foreign tax treatment is favorable. We
"nd that favorable foreign tax treatment relative to the U.S. is fairly important
(overall rating of 2.26 in Table 7). Big "rms (2.41) with large foreign exposure
(2.50) are relatively likely to indicate that foreign tax treatment is an important
210
J.R. Graham, C.R. Harvey / Journal of Financial Economics 60 (2001) 187}243
factor. This could indicate that "rms need a certain level of sophistication and
exposure to perform international tax planning.
In contrast, we "nd very little evidence that "rms directly consider personal
taxes when deciding on debt policy (rating of 0.68 in Table 6) or equity policy
(rating of 0.82 in Table 8, the least popular equity issuance factor). Therefore, it
seems unlikely that "rms target investors in certain tax clienteles (although we
can not rule out the possibility that investors choose to invest in "rms based on
payout policy, or that executives respond to personal tax considerations to the
extent that they are re#ected in market prices, see Graham, 1999a).
When we ask "rms directly about whether potential costs of distress a!ect
their debt decisions, we "nd they are not very important (rating of 1.24 in
Table 6), although they are relatively important among speculative-grade "rms.
However, "rms are very concerned about their credit ratings (rating of 2.46, the
second most important debt factor), which can be viewed as an indication of
concern about distress. Among utilities and "rms that have rated debt, credit
ratings are a very important determinant of debt policy. Credit ratings are also
important for large "rms (3.14) that are in the Fortune 500 (3.31). Finally, CFOs
are also concerned about earnings volatility when making debt decisions (rating
of 2.32), which is consistent with the trade-o! theory's prediction that "rms
reduce debt usage when the probability of bankruptcy is high (Castanias, 1983).
We ask directly whether "rms have an optimal or `targeta debt}equity ratio.
Nineteen percent of the "rms do not have a target debt ratio or target range (see
Fig. 1G). Another 37% have a #exible target, and 34% have a somewhat tight
target or range. The remaining 10% have a strict target debt ratio (see Fig. 6).
These overall numbers provide mixed support for the notion that companies
trade o! costs and bene"ts to derive an optimal debt ratio. However, un-
tabulated analysis shows that large "rms are more likely to have target debt
ratios: 55% of large "rms have at least somewhat strict target ratios, compared
to 36% of small "rms. Targets that are tight or somewhat strict are more
common among investment-grade (64%) than speculative "rms (41%), and
among regulated (67%) than unregulated "rms (43%). Targets are important if
the CEO has short tenure or is young, and when the top three o$cers own less
than 5% of the "rm.
Finally, the CFOs tell us that their companies issue equity to maintain
a target debt}equity ratio (rating of 2.26; Row e of Table 8), especially if their
"rm is highly levered (2.68), "rm ownership is widely dispersed (2.64), or the
CEO is young (2.41). Overall, the survey evidence provides moderate support for
the trade-o! theory.
5.1.2. Deviations from target debt ratios
Actual debt ratios vary across "rms and through time. Such variability might
occur if debt intensity is measured relative to the market value of equity, and yet
"rms do not rebalance their debt lock-step with changes in equity prices. Our

evidence supports this hypothesis: the mean response of 1.08 indicates that "rms
do not rebalance in response to market equity movements (Row g in Table 9).
Further, among "rms targeting their debt ratio, few "rms (rating of 0.99) state
that changes in the price of equity a!ect their debt policy. Similarly, in their
large-sample study of Compustat "rms, Opler and Titman (1998) "nd that "rms
issue equity after stock price increases, which they note is inconsistent with "rms
targeting debt ratios because it moves them further from any such target.
Fisher et al. (1989) propose an alternative explanation of why debt ratios vary
over time, even if "rms have a target. If there are "xed transactions costs to
issuing or retiring debt, a "rm only rebalances when its debt ratio crosses an
upper or lower hurdle. We "nd moderate evidence that "rms consider transac-
tions costs when making debt issuance decisions (rating of 1.95 in Row e of
Table 6), especially among small "rms (2.07) in which the CEO has been in o$ce
for at least ten years (2.22). Many papers (e.g., Titman and Wessels, 1988)
interpret the "nding that small "rms use relatively little debt as evidence that
transaction costs discourage debt usage among small "rms; as far as we know,
our analysis is the most direct examination of this hypothesis to date. However,
when we ask whether they delay issuing debt (rating of 1.06 in Table 9) or
retiring debt (1.04) because of transactions costs, which is a more direct test of
the Fisher et al. (1989) hypothesis, the support for the transactions cost hypothe-
sis is weak.
5.2. Asymmetric information explanations of capital structure
5.2.1. Pecking-order model of xnancing hierarchy
The pecking-order model of "nancing choice assumes that "rms do not target
a speci"c debt ratio, but instead use external "nancing only when internal funds
are insu$cient. External funds are less desirable because informational asym-
metries between management and investors imply that external funds are
undervalued in relation to the degree of asymmetry (Myers and Majluf, 1984;
Myers, 1984). Therefore, if "rms use external funds, they prefer to use debt,
convertible securities, and, as a last resort, equity.
Myers and Majluf (1984) assume that "rms seek to maintain "nancial slack to
avoid the need for external funds. Therefore, if we "nd that "rms value "nancial
#exibility, this is generally consistent with the pecking-order theory. However,
#exibility is also important for reasons unrelated to the pecking-order model
(e.g., Opler et al., 1999), so "nding that CFOs value "nancial #exibility is not
su$cient to prove that the pecking-order model is the true description of capital
structure choice.
We ask several questions related to the pecking-order model. We ask if "rms
issue securities when internal funds are not su$cient to fund their activities, and
separately ask if equity is used when debt, convertibles, or other sources of
"nancing are not available. We also inquire whether executives consider equity

Fig. 6. Survey evidence on whether "rms have optimal or target debt}equity ratios. The survey is
based on the responses of 392 CFOs.
 Pinegar and Wilbricht (1989) survey 176 unregulated, non"nancial Fortune 500 "rms. Like us,
they "nd that #exibility is the most important factor a!ecting "nancing decisions, and that
bankruptcy costs and personal tax considerations are among the least important. Our analysis,
examining a broader cross-section of theoretical hypotheses and using information on "rm and
executive characteristics, shows that the relative importance of these factors is robust to a more
general survey design.
undervaluation when deciding which security to use, and whether "nancial
#exibility is important.
The most important item a!ecting corporate debt decisions is management's
desire for `"nancial #exibility,a with a mean rating of 2.59 (Table 6). Four "rms
write in explicitly that they remain #exible in the sense of minimizing interest
obligations, so that they do not need to shrink their business in case of an
economic downturn. In untabulated analysis, we "nd that "rms that value
"nancial #exibility are more likely to value real options in project evaluation,
but the di!erence is not signi"cant. Fifty-nine percent of the respondents say
that #exibility is important (rating of 3) or very important (rating of 4). This
"nding is interesting because Graham (2000) shows that "rms use their "nancial
#exibility (i.e., preserve debt capacity) to make future expansions and acquisi-
tions, but they appear to retain a lot of unused #exibility even after expanding.
However, the importance of #exibility in the survey responses is not related to
informational asymmetry (size or dividend payout) or growth options in the
manner suggested by the pecking-order theory. In fact, #exibility is statistically
218
J.R. Graham, C.R. Harvey / Journal of Financial Economics 60 (2001) 187}243
more important for dividend-paying "rms, opposite the theoretical prediction (if
dividend-paying "rms have relatively little informational asymmetry). There-
fore, a deeper investigation indicates that the desire for "nancial #exibility is not
driven by the factors behind the pecking-order theory.
Having insu$cient internal funds is a moderately important in#uence on the
decision to issue debt (rating of 2.13, Row a in Table 9). This behavior is
generally consistent with the pecking-order model. More small "rms (rating of
2.30) than large "rms (1.88) indicate that they use debt in the face of insu$cient
internal funds, which is consistent with the pecking-order if small "rms su!er
from larger asymmetric-information-related equity undervaluation. However,
there is only modest evidence that "rms issue equity because recent pro"ts have
been insu$cient to fund activities (1.76 in Table 8), and even less indicating that
"rms issue equity after their ability to obtain funds from debt or convertibles is
diminished (rating of 1.15 in Table 10).
Firms are reluctant to issue common stock when they perceive that it is
undervalued (rating of 2.69, the most important equity issuance factor in
Table 8). In a separate survey conducted one month after ours, when the Dow
Jones 30 was approaching a new record of 10,000, Graham (1999b) "nds that
more than two-thirds of FEI executives feel that their common equity is
undervalued by the market and that only 3% of CFOs think their stock is
overvalued, suggesting that the preference for pecking-order-like behavior
might be driven by managerial optimism (Heaton, 2000). Taken together, these
"ndings indicate that a large percentage of companies are hesitant to issue
common equity because they feel their stock is undervalued. Many "rms issue
convertible debt instead: equity undervaluation is the second most popular
factor a!ecting convertible debt policy (rating of 2.34 in Table 10), a response
particularly popular among growth "rms (2.72).
Finding that "rms avoid equity when they perceive that it is undervalued is
generally consistent with the pecking order. However, when we examine more
carefully how equity undervaluation a!ects "nancing decisions, the support for
the pecking-order model wanes. In debt decisions, large (rating of 1.76 in Row
d of Table 9), dividend-paying (1.65) "rms are relatively more likely to say that
equity undervaluation a!ects their debt policy (versus ratings of 1.37 for both
small and nondividend-paying "rms). In equity decisions, the relative import-
ance of stock valuation on equity issuance is not related to informational
asymmetry as indicated by small size and nondividend-paying status, though it
is more important for "rms with low executive ownership. In general, these
"ndings are not consistent with the pecking-order idea that informationally
induced equity undervaluation causes "rms to avoid equity "nancing. Helwege
and Liang (1996, p. 457) also "nd that `asymmetric information variables have
no power to predict the relative use of public bonds over equity.a
In sum, the importance of "nancial #exibility and equity undervaluation to
security issuance decisions is generally consistent with the pecking-order model

of "nancing hierarchy. However, asymmetric information does not appear to
cause the importance of these factors, as it should if the pecking-order model is
the true model of capital structure choice.
5.2.2. Recent increase in price of common stock
We investigate whether "rms issue stock during a `window of opportunitya
that arises because their stock price has recently increased, as argued by
Loughran and Ritter (1995). Lucas and McDonald (1990) put an informational
asymmetry spin on the desire to issue equity after stock price increases: If
a "rm's stock price is undervalued due to informational asymmetry, it delays
issuing until after an informational release (of good news) and the ensuing
increase in stock price.
Recent stock price performance is the third most popular factor a!ecting
equity-issuance decisions (rating of 2.53 in Table 8), in support of the `window of
opportunitya. Consistent with Lucas and McDonald (1990), the window of
opportunity is most important for "rms su!ering from informational asymmet-
ries (i.e., not paying dividends).
5.2.3. Signaling private information with debt and equity
Ross (1977) and Leland and Pyle (1977) argue that "rms use capital structure
to signal their quality or future prospects. However, very few "rms indicate that
their debt policy is a!ected by factors consistent with signaling (rating of 0.96 in
Table 9). In addition to small absolute importance, companies more likely to
su!er from informational asymmetries, such as small, private (0.51) "rms, are
relatively unlikely to use debt to signal future prospects (see Row b in Table 9).
We also "nd little evidence that "rms issue equity to give the market a positive
impression of their prospects (rating of 1.31 in Table 8). Sending a positive signal
via equity issuance is relatively more popular among speculative, nondividend-
paying "rms.
5.2.4. Private information and convertible stock issuance
Brennan and Kraus (1987) and Brennan and Schwartz (1988) argue that the
call or conversion feature makes convertible debt relatively insensitive to asym-
metric information (between management and investors) about the risk of the
"rm. We "nd moderate support for this argument. Firms use convertible debt to
attract investors unsure about the riskiness of the company (rating of 2.07 in
Table 10). This response is relatively more popular among "rms for which
outside investors are likely to know less than management about "rm risk, i.e.,
small "rms (2.35) with large managerial ownership (2.47).
Stein (1992) argues that if "rms privately know that their stock is under-
valued, they prefer to avoid issuing equity. At the same time, they want to
minimize the distress costs that come with debt issuance. Convertible debt is
`delayeda common stock that has lower distress costs than debt and smaller
222
J.R. Graham, C.R. Harvey / Journal of Financial Economics 60 (2001) 187}243
undervaluation than equity. We "nd strong evidence consistent with Stein's
argument that convertibles are `back-door equity.a Among "rms that issue
convertible debt, the most popular factor is that convertibles are an inexpensive
way to issue delayed common stock (rating of 2.49 in Table 10).
5.2.5. Anticipating improvement in credit ratings
Having private information about credit quality can a!ect a "rm's optimal
debt maturity. In theory, if "rms privately know they are high quality but are
currently assigned a low credit rating, they issue short-term debt because they
expect their rating to improve (Flannery, 1986; Kale and Noe, 1990). In practice,
the evidence that "rms time their credit worthiness is weak. The mean response
is only 0.85 (Row e, Table 11) that companies borrow short-term because they
expect their credit rating to improve. This response receives more support from
companies with speculative grade debt (1.18) and those that do not pay divi-
dends (0.99). Though not of large absolute magnitude, this last answer is
consistent with "rms timing their credit ratings when they are subject to large
informational asymmetries.
5.2.6. Timing market interest rates
Although relatively few executives time changes in their credit ratings (some-
thing about which they might reasonably have private information), we "nd
surprising indications that they try to time the market in other ways. We inquire
whether executives attempt to time interest rates by issuing debt when they feel
that market interest rates are particularly low. The rating of 2.22 in Table
6 provides moderately strong evidence that "rms try to time the market in this
sense. Market timing is especially important for large "rms (2.40), which implies
that companies are more likely to time interest rates when they have a large or
sophisticated treasury department.
We also "nd evidence that "rms issue short-term debt in an e!ort to time
market interest rates. CFOs borrow short-term when they feel that short rates
are low relative to long rates (1.89 in Table 11) or when they expect long-term
rates to decline (1.78). Finally, we check if "rms use foreign debt because foreign
interest rates are lower than domestic rates. There is moderate evidence that
relatively low foreign interest rates a!ect the decision to issue abroad (rating of
2.19). Though insigni"cant, small (2.33) growth (2.27) "rms are more likely to
make this claim. If covered interest rate parity holds, it is not clear to us why
"rms pursue this strategy.

and pass up positive NPV projects if they perceive that the pro"ts will be used to
pay o! existing debtholders. This cost is most acute among growth "rms. Myers
(1977) argues that "rms can limit total debt, or use short-term debt, to minimize
underinvestment costs. Froot, Scharfstein, and Stein (1993) argue that "rms can
hedge or otherwise maintain "nancial #exibility to avoid these costs of underin-
vestment.
We ask "rms if their choice between short- and long-term debt, or their
overall debt policy, is related to their desire to pay long-term pro"ts to share-
holders, not debtholders. The absolute number of "rms indicating that their
debt policy is a!ected by underinvestment concerns is small (rating of 1.01 in
Table 6). However, more growth (1.09) than nongrowth "rms (0.69) are likely to
indicate that underinvestment problems are a concern, which is consistent with
the theory. We "nd little support for the idea that short-term debt is used to
alleviate the underinvestment problem. The mean response is only 0.94 (Row
d in Table 11) that short-term borrowing is used to allow returns from new
projects to be captured by long-term shareholders, and there is no statistical
di!erence in the response between growth and nongrowth "rms.
Overall, support for the underinvestment argument is weak. This is interesting
because it contrasts with the "nding in many large sample studies that debt
usage is inversely related to variables measuring growth options (i.e., market-
to-book ratios), which those studies interpret as evidence that underinvestment
costs a!ects debt policy (e.g., Graham, 1996).
Stockholders capture investment returns above those required to service debt
payments and other liabilities, and at the same time have limited liability when
returns are insu$cient to fully pay debtholders. Therefore, stockholders prefer
high-risk projects, in con#ict with bondholder preferences. Leland and Toft
(1996) argue that using short-term debt reduces this agency con#ict (see also
Barnea et al., 1980).
In contrast to this hypothesis, however, we "nd little evidence that executives
issue short-term debt to minimize asset substitution problems. The mean re-
sponse is only 0.53 (Table 11) that executives feel that short-term borrowing
reduces the chance that shareholders will want to take on risky projects.
Green (1984) argues that convertible debt can circumvent the asset substitu-
tion problem that arises when "rms accept projects that are riskier than
bondholders would prefer. However, we "nd little evidence that "rms use
convertibles to protect bondholders against unfavorable actions by managers or
stockholders (rating of 0.62 in Table 10).
5.3.2. Conyicts between managers and equityholders
Jensen (1986) and others argue that when a "rm has ample free cash #ow, its
managers can squander the cash by consuming perquisites or making ine$cient
investment decisions. We inquire whether "rms use debt to commit to pay out
free cash #ows and thereby discipline management into working e$ciently
226
J.R. Graham, C.R. Harvey / Journal of Financial Economics 60 (2001) 187}243
along the lines suggested by Jensen. We "nd very little evidence that "rms
discipline managers in this way (mean rating of 0.33, the second lowest rating
among all factors a!ecting debt policy in Table 6). It is important to note,
however, that 1) managers might be unwilling to admit to using debt in this
manner, or 2) perhaps a low rating on this question re#ects an unwillingness of
"rms to adopt Jensen's solution more than a weakness in Jensen's argument.
5.4. Product market and industry factors
Bradley et al. (1984) "nd that debt ratios di!er markedly across industries.
One explanation for this pattern is that the product market environment or
nature of competition varies across industries in a way that a!ects optimal debt
policy. For example, Titman (1984) suggests that customers avoid purchasing
a "rm's products if they think that the "rm might go out of business (and
therefore not stand behind its products), especially if the products are unique;
consequently, "rms that produce unique products might avoid using debt.
Brander and Lewis (1986) model another way that production and "nancing
decisions can be intertwined. They hypothesize that, by using substantial debt,
a "rm can provide a credible threat to rivals that it will not reduce production.
We "nd little evidence that product market factors a!ect debt decisions.
Executives assign a mean rating of 1.24 to the proposition that debt should be
limited so that a "rm's customers or suppliers do not become concerned that the
"rm might go out of business (Table 6). Moreover, high-tech "rms (which we
assume produce unique products) are less likely than other "rms to limit debt
for this reason, contrary to Titman's prediction. We do "nd that, in comparison
to nongrowth "rms (1.00), relatively many growth "rms (1.43) claim that cus-
tomers might not purchase their products if they are worried that debt usage
might cause the "rm to go out of business. This is consistent with Titman's
theory if growth "rms produce unique products. Finally, there is no evidence
supporting the Brander and Lewis hypothesis that debt provides a credible
production threat (rating of 0.40).
Though we do not "nd much evidence that product market factors drive
industry di!erences in debt ratios, we ask executives whether their capital
structure decisions are a!ected by the "nancing policy of other "rms in their
industries. This is important because some papers de"ne a "rm's target debt
ratio as the industry-wide ratio (e.g., Opler and Titman, 1998; Gilson, 1997).
We "nd only modest evidence that managers are concerned about the debt
levels of their competitors (rating of 1.49 in Table 6). Recall, however, that credit
ratings are important to debt decisions and note that industry debt ratios are an
important input for bond ratings. Rival debt ratios are relatively important for
regulated companies (2.32), Fortune 500 "rms (1.86), public "rms (rating of 1.63
versus 1.27 for private "rms), and "rms that target their debt ratio (1.60).
Moreover, equity issuance decisions are not in#uenced greatly by the equity
J.R. Graham, C.R. Harvey / Journal of Financial Economics 60 (2001) 187}243
227
policies of other "rms in a given industry (rating of 1.45 in Table 8). Finally, we
"nd even less evidence that "rms use convertibles because other "rms in their
industry do so (1.10 in Table 10).
5.5. Control contests
Capital structure can be used to in#uence, or can be a!ected by, corporate
control contests and managerial share ownership (e.g., Harris and Raviv, 1988;
Stulz, 1988). We "nd moderate evidence that "rms issue equity to dilute the
stock holdings of certain shareholders (rating of 2.14 in Table 8). This tactic is
popular among speculative-grade companies (2.24); however, it is not related to
the number of shares held by managers. We also ask if "rms use debt to reduce
the likelihood that the "rm will become a takeover target. We "nd little support
for this hypothesis (rating of 0.73 in Table 6).
5.6. Risk management
Capital structure can be used to manage risk. GeH czy et al. (1997, p. 1331) note
that `foreign denominated debt can act as a natural hedge of foreign revenuesa
and displace the need to hedge with currency derivatives. We ask whether "rms
use foreign debt because it acts as a natural hedge, and separately how impor-
tant it is to keep the source close to the use of funds. Among the 31% of
respondents who seriously considered issuing foreign debt, the most popular
reason they did so is to provide a natural hedge against foreign currency
devaluation (mean rating of 3.15 in Table 7). Providing a natural hedge is most
important for public "rms (3.21) with large foreign exposure (3.34). The second
most important factor a!ecting the use of foreign debt is keeping the source
close to the use of funds (rating of 2.67), especially for small (3.09), manufacturing
"rms (2.92).
Risk-management practices can also explain why "rms match the maturity of
assets and liabilities. If asset and liability duration are not aligned, interest rate
#uctuations can a!ect the amount of funds available for investment and day-to-
day operations. We ask "rms how they choose debt maturity. The most popular
explanation of how "rms choose between short- and long-term debt is that they
match debt maturity with asset life (rating of 2.60 in Table 11). Maturity-
matching is most important for small (2.69), private (2.85) "rms.
5.7. Practical, cash management considerations
Liquidity and cash management a!ect corporate "nancial decisions, often in
ways that are not as `deepa as the factors driving academic models. For
example, many companies issue long-term so that they do not have to re"nance
in `bad timesa (rating of 2.15 in Table 11). This is especially important for highly
228
J.R. Graham, C.R. Harvey / Journal of Financial Economics 60 (2001) 187}243
levered (2.55), manufacturing (2.37) "rms. The CFOs also say that equity is often
issued simply to provide shares to bonus/option plans (2.34 in Table 8), parti-
cularly among investment-grade "rms (2.77) with a young CEO (2.65).
The hand-written responses indicate that practical considerations a!ect the
maturity structure of borrowing (see B.7 on the Internet site, Appendix B). Four
"rms explicitly say that they tie their scheduled principal repayments to their
projected ability to repay. Another six diversify debt maturity to limit the
magnitude of their re"nancing activity in any given year. Other "rms borrow for
the length of time they think they will need funds, or borrow short-term until
su$cient debt has accumulated to justify borrowing long-term.
5.8. Other factors awecting capital structure
5.8.1. Debt
We ask if having debt allows "rms to bargain for concessions from employees
(Chang, 1992; Hanka, 1998). We "nd no indication that this is the case (mean
rating of 0.16 in Table 6, the lowest rating for any question on the survey). Not
a single respondent said that debt is important or very important as a bargain-
ing device (rating of 3 or 4). We also check if "rms issue debt after recently
accumulating substantial pro"ts (Opler and Titman, 1998). The executives do
not recognize this as an important factor a!ecting debt policy (rating 0.53 in
Table 9).
Fourteen "rms write that they choose debt to minimize their weighted
average cost of capital (see B.5 on the Internet site, Appendix B). Ten write,
essentially, that they borrow to fund projects or growth, but only as needed. Five
indicate that bond or bank covenants a!ect their debt policy.
5.8.2. Common stock
We investigate whether concern about earnings dilution a!ects equity
issuance decisions. The textbook view is that earnings are not diluted if a "rm
earns the required return on the new equity. Conversely, if funds are obtained by
issuing debt, the number of shares remains constant and so EPS can increase.
However, the equity is levered and therefore more risky, so Modigliani and
Miller's `conservation of valuea tells us that the stock price will not increase due
to higher EPS. Nonetheless, Brealey and Myers (1996) indicate that there is
a common belief among executives that share issuance dilutes earnings per share
(on p. 396, Brealey and Myers call this view a `fallacya). To investigate this issue,
we ask if earnings per share concerns a!ect decisions about issuing common
stock.
Among the 38% of "rms that seriously considered issuing common equity
during the sample period, earnings dilution is the most important factor a!ect-
ing their decision (mean rating of 2.84 in Table 8 and a mean rating of 3.18
among public "rms). The popularity of this response is intriguing (see Fig. 7). It

229

survey is based on the responses of 392 CFOs.
either indicates that executives focus more than they should on earnings dilution
(if the standard textbook view is correct), or that the standard textbook treat-
ment misses an important aspect of earnings dilution. EPS dilution is a big
concern among regulated companies (3.60), even though in many cases the
regulatory process ensures that utilities earn their required cost of capital,
implying that EPS dilution should not a!ect share price. Concern about EPS
dilution is strong among large (3.12), dividend-paying "rms (3.06). EPS dilution
is less important when the CEO has an MBA (2.62) than when he or she does not
(2.95), perhaps because the executive has read Brealey and Myers!
We inquire whether common stock is a "rm's least risky or cheapest source of
funds. Williamson (1988) argues that equity is a cheap source of funds with
which to "nance low-speci"city assets. A modest number of the executives state
that they use equity because it is the least risky source of funds (rating of 1.76 in
Table 8). The idea that equity has low risk is more popular among "rms with the
characteristics of a new or start-up "rm: small (1.93) with growth options (2.07).
The idea that common stock is the cheapest source of funds is less popular
(rating of 1.10), although "rms with start-up characteristics are more likely to
have this belief. Unreported analysis indicates that there is a positive correlation
between believing that equity is the cheapest and that it is the least risky source
of funds.
Nine companies indicate that they issue common stock because it is the
`preferred currencya for making acquisitions, especially for the pooling method
of accounting (see B.9 on the Internet site, Appendix B). Two "rms write that
230

based on the responses of 392 CFOs.
they issue stock because it is the natural form of "nancing for them in their
current stage of corporate development.
5.8.3. Convertible debt
We ask the executives whether the ability to call or force conversion is an
important feature a!ecting convertible debt policy. Among the one-in-"ve "rms
that seriously considered issuing convertible debt, there is moderate evidence
that executives like convertibles because of the ability to call or force conversion
(rating of 2.29 in Table 10). Though not a direct test, the popularity of the
call/conversion feature is consistent with Mayers' (1998) hypothesis that con-
vertible debt allows funding of pro"table future projects but attenuates overin-
vestment incentives. The factors used in decisions to issue convertible debt are
presented in Fig. 8.
Billingsley et al. (1985) document that convertibles cost on average 50 basis
points less than straight debt. However, relatively few CFOs indicate that they
use convertible debt because it is less expensive than straight debt (rating of
1.85). Companies run by mature executives are more likely to issue convertibles
because they are less costly than straight debt (2.50).
Billingsley and Smith (1996) also "nd that convertibles are favored as delayed
equity and because management feels that common equity is undervalued.
Contrary to our results, Billingsley and Smith "nd fairly strong evidence that
"rms are in#uenced by the convertible use of other "rms in their industry. Also
in contrast to our results, they "nd that the most important factor a!ecting the
use of convertibles is the lower cash costs/coupon rate versus straight debt. One
di!erence between our study and theirs is that they request a response relative to
J.R. Graham, C.R. Harvey / Journal of Financial Economics 60 (2001) 187}243
231
a speci"c o!ering among "rms that actually issue convertible debt. We condi-
tion only on whether a "rm seriously considered issuing convertibles.
5.8.4. Foreign debt
Grinblatt and Titman (1998) note that capital markets have become increas-
ingly global in recent decades and that U.S. "rms frequently raise funds over-
seas. We indicate above that "rms issue foreign debt in response to tax
incentives, to keep the source close to the use of funds, and in an attempt to take
advantage of low foreign interest rates. Five "rms write that they borrow
overseas to broaden their sources of "nancing (see B.8 on the Internet site,
Appendix B). Few "rms indicate that foreign regulations require them to issue
abroad (rating of 0.61 in Table 7).
6. Conclusions
Our survey of the practice of corporate "nance is both reassuring and
puzzling. For example, it is reassuring that NPV is dramatically more important
now as a project evaluation method than, as indicated in past surveys, it was 10
or 20 years ago. The CAPM is also widely used. However, it is surprising that
more than half of the respondents would use their "rm's overall discount rate to
evaluate a project in an overseas market, even though the project likely has
di!erent risk attributes than the overall "rm. This indicates that practitioners
might not apply the CAPM or NPV rule correctly. It is also interesting that
CFOs pay very little attention to risk factors based on momentum and book-
to-market value.
We identify fundamental di!erences between small and large "rms. Our
research suggests that small "rms are less sophisticated when it comes to
evaluating risky projects. Small "rms are signi"cantly less likely to use the NPV
criterion or the capital asset pricing model and its variants. Perhaps these and
our other "ndings about the e!ect of "rm size will help academics understand
the pervasive relation between size and corporate practices. Further, the fact
that the practice of corporate "nance di!ers based on "rm size could be an
underlying cause of size-related asset pricing anomalies.
In our analysis of capital structure, we "nd that informal criteria such as
"nancial #exibility and credit ratings are the most important debt policy factors.
Other informal criteria such as EPS dilution and recent stock price appreciation
are the most important factors in#uencing equity issuance. The degree of stock
undervaluation is also important to equity issuance, and we know from other
surveys that most executives feel their stock is undervalued.
We "nd moderate support that "rms follow the trade-o! theory and target
their debt ratio. Other results, such as the importance of equity undervaluation
and "nancial #exibility, are generally consistent with the pecking-order view.
However, the evidence in favor of these theories does not hold up as well under
232
J.R. Graham, C.R. Harvey / Journal of Financial Economics 60 (2001) 187}243
closer scrutiny (e.g., the evidence is generally not consistent with informational
asymmetry causing pecking-order-like behavior), and is weaker still for more
subtle theories. We "nd mixed or little evidence that signaling, transactions
costs, underinvestment costs, asset substitution, bargaining with employees, free
cash #ow considerations, and product market concerns a!ect capital structure
choice. Table 12 summarizes our capital structure "ndings.
In summary, executives use the mainline techniques that business schools
have taught for years, NPV and CAPM, to value projects and to estimate the
cost of equity. Interestingly, "nancial executives are much less likely to follow
the academically proscribed factors and theories when determining capital
structure. This last "nding raises possibilities that require additional thought
and research. Perhaps the relatively weak support for many capital structure
theories indicates that it is time to critically reevaluate the assumptions and
implications of these mainline theories. Alternatively, perhaps the theories are
valid descriptions of what "rms should do}but corporations ignore the theoret-
ical advice. One explanation for this last possibility is that business schools
might be better at teaching capital budgeting and the cost of capital than at
teaching capital structure. Moreover, perhaps NPV and the CAPM are more
widely understood than capital structure theories because they make more
precise predictions and have been accepted as mainstream views for longer.
Additional research is needed to investigate these issues.

Appendix. Nonresponse bias and other issues related to survey data
We perform several experiments to investigate whether nonresponse bias
might a!ect our results. The "rst experiment, suggested by Wallace and Mellor
(1988), compares the responses for "rms that returned the survey on time (i.e., by
February 23) to those that did not return the survey until February 24, 1999 or
later. The "rms that did not respond on time can be thought of as a sample from
the nonresponse group, in the sense that they did not return the survey until we
pestered them further. We "rst test, for each question, whether the mean
response for the early respondents di!ers from the mean for the late respon-
dents. There are 88 questions not related to "rm characteristics. The mean
answers for the early and late respondents are statistically di!erent for only eight
(13) of these 88 questions at a 5% (10%) level.
Because the answers are correlated across di!erent questions, we also perform
multivariate  tests comparing the early and late responses. We calculate
multivariate test statistics for each set of subquestions, grouped by the main
question. (That is, one  is calculated for the 12 subquestions related to the "rst
question on the survey, another  for the six subquestions related to the second
survey question, etc.) Out of the 10 multivariate  s comparing the means for
the early and late responses, none (two) are signi"cantly di!erent at a 5% (10%)
level. Following the order of the tables as they appear in the text, the multivari-
ate analysis of variance p-values for each of the ten questions are 0.209, 0.063,
0.085, 0.892, 0.124, 0.705, 0.335, 0.922, 0.259, and 0.282. A low p-value indicates
signi"cant di!erences between the early and late responses. Finally, a single
multivariate  across all 88 subquestions does not detect signi"cant di!erences
between the early and late responses ( p-value of 0.254). The rationale of Wallace
and Mellor suggests that because the responses for these two groups of "rms are
similar, non-response bias is not a major problem.
The second set of experiments, suggested by Moore and Reichert (1983),
investigates possible non-response bias by comparing characteristics of respon-
ding "rms to characteristics for the population at large. If the characteristics
between the two groups match, then the sample can be thought of as represent-
ing the population. This task is somewhat challenging because we have only
limited information about the FEI population of "rms. (Given that most
Fortune 500 "rms are also in the FEI population, we focus on FEI character-
istics. We ignore any di!erences in population characteristics that may be
attributable to the 187 "rms that are in the Fortune 500 but not in FEI.) We
have reliable information on three characteristics for the population of "rms
that belong to FEI: general industry classi"cation, public versus private owner-
ship, and number of employees.
We "rst use  goodness-of-"t analysis to determine whether the responses
represent the industry groupings in roughly the same proportion as that found
in the FEI population. Sixty-three percent of FEI members are from heavy
J.R. Graham, C.R. Harvey / Journal of Financial Economics 60 (2001) 187}243
237
manufacturing industries (manufacturing, energy, and transportation), as are
62% of the respondents. These percentages are not signi"cantly di!erent at the
5% level. Therefore, the heavy manufacturing versus non-manufacturing break-
down that we use in the tables is representative of the FEI population. We also
examine public versus private ownership. Sixty percent of FEI "rms are publicly
owned, as are 64% of the sample "rms. Again, these numbers are not statistically
di!erent, suggesting that our numbers represent the FEI population, and also
that our public versus private analysis is appropriate.
Although we do not have reliable information about the dividend policies,
P/E ratios, sales revenue, or debt ratios for the FEI population, our analysis
relies heavily on these variables, so we perform Monte Carlo simulations to
determine the representativeness of our sample. Speci"cally, we take a random
sample of 392 "rms from the Compustat database, stratifying on the number of
employees in FEI "rms. That is, we sample from Compustat so that 15.4% of the
draws are from "rms with at least 20,000 employees, 24.7% are from "rms with
between 5,000 and 19,999 employees, etc., because these are the percentages for
the FEI population. We then calculate the mean debt ratio, sales revenue, and
P/E ratio (ignoring "rms with negative earnings), and the percentage of "rms
that pay dividends for the randomly drawn "rms. We repeat this process 1,000
times to determine an empirical distribution of mean values for each variable.
We then compare the mean values for our sample to the empirical distribution.
If, for example, the mean debt ratio for the responding "rms is larger than 950 of
the mean debt ratios in the Monte Carlo simulation, we would conclude that
there is statistical evidence that respondent "rms are more highly levered than
are "rms in the overall population.
The sample values for sales revenue and debt ratios fall comfortably near
the middle of the empirical distributions, indicating that the sample is repre-
sentative for these two characteristics. The mean P/E ratio of 17 for the sample
is statistically smaller than the mean for the Compustat sample (overall mean
of approximately 20). Fifty-four percent of the sample "rms pay dividends,
compared to
approximately 45% in
the strati"ed Compustat sample.
Although the sample and population di!er statistically for these last two traits,
the economic di!erences are small enough to indicate that our sample is
representative of the population from which it is drawn. There are at least
three reasons why our Monte Carlo experiment might indicate statistical
di!erences, even if our sample "rms are actually representative of the FEI
population: (1) there are systematic di!erences between the Compustat and
FEI populations not controlled for with the strati"cation based on number
of employees, (2) the strati"cation is based on FEI "rms only, although the
survey `oversamplesa Fortune 500 "rms, and (3) we deleted "rms with
negative P/E ratios in the Monte Carlo simulations, although survey res-
pondents might have entered a P/E ratio of zero or something else if they had
negative earnings.
238
J.R. Graham, C.R. Harvey / Journal of Financial Economics 60 (2001) 187}243
Finally, given that much corporate "nance research analyzes Compustat
"rms, we repeat the Monte Carlo experiment without stratifying by number of
employees. That is, we randomly draw 392 "rms (1,000 times) from Compustat
without conditioning on the number of employees. This experiment tells us
whether our sample "rms adequately represent Compustat "rms, to provide an
indication of how directly our survey results can be compared to Compustat-
based research. The mean debt ratio, sales revenue, and P/E ratios are not
statistically di!erent from the means in the Compustat data; however, the
percentage of "rms paying dividends is smaller than for the overall Compustat
sample. Aside from dividend payout, the "rms that responded to our survey are
similar to Compustat "rms.
If one accepts that nonresponse bias is small, there are still concerns about
survey data. For one thing, the respondents might not answer truthfully. Given
that the survey is anonymous, we feel this problem is minimal. Moreover, our
assessment from the phone conversations is that the executives would not take
the time to "ll out a survey if their intent was to be untruthful.
Another potential problem with survey data is that the questions, no matter
how carefully crafted, either might not be properly understood or might not
elicit the appropriate information. For example, Stigler (1966) asks managers if
their "rms maximize pro"ts. The general response is that, no, they take care of
their employees, are responsible corporate citizens, etc. However, when Stigler
asks whether the "rms could increase pro"ts by increasing or decreasing prices,
the answer is again no. Observations such as these can be used to argue that
there is some sort of `economic Darwinisma, in which the "rms that survive
must be doing the proper things, even if unintentionally. Or, as Milton Fried-
man (1953) notes, a good pool player has the skill to knock the billiards balls
into one another just right, even if he or she can not solve a di!erential equation.
Finally, Cli! Smith tells about a chef who, after tasting the un"nished product,
always knew exactly which ingredient to add to perfect the day's recipe, but
could never write down the proper list of ingredients after the meal was
complete. These examples suggest that managers might use the proper tech-
niques, or at least take the correct actions, even if their answers to a survey do
not indicate so. If other "rms copy the actions of successful "rms, then it is
possible that many "rms take appropriate actions without thinking within the
box of an academic model.
This set of critiques is impossible to completely refute. We have attempted to
be very careful when designing the questions on the survey. We also feel that by
contrasting the answers conditional on "rm characteristics, we should be able to
detect patterns in the responses that shed light on the importance of di!erent
theories, even if the questions are not perfect in every dimension. Ultimately,
however, the analysis we perform and conclusions we reach must be interpreted
keeping in mind that our data are from a survey. Having said this, we feel
that these data are representative and provide much unique information that

complements what we can learn from traditional large-sample analysis and
clinical studies.
